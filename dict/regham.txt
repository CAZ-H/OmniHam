Excuse me, sir, is there a commode?

Mom: Justin!
Dad: Quick, honey, take my picture. I got the pyramid in my hand.
Mom: Justin, you get back here right now!
Guards: No, stop! No, no! Stop him! Go back! Don't climb! Wait, wait. Hold on. Easy, little boy. Okay, stop, child! Stop right there. No! No, no, no! There he goes.
Mom: Justin! I've got him! I've got him!
[Justin lands on his dad and the pyramid deflates]
News Announcer: Outrage in Egypt tonight as it was discovered that the Great Pyramid of Giza had been stolen and replaced by a giant inflatable replica. There is panic throughout the globe as countries and citizens try to protect their beloved landmarks. Law enforcement still has no leads, leaving everyone to wonder: which of the world's villains is responsible for this heinous crime? And where will he strike next?
I'm having a bad, bad day It's about time that I get my way Steamrolling whatever I see Freeze ray! Freeze ray! Freeze ray! I'm having a bad, bad day If you take it personal, that's okay Watch, this is so fun to see Despicable me Morning, Gru! How you doing?

Gru: Hello, Fred. FYI, your dog has been leaving little bombs all over my yard, and I don't appreciate it.
Fred: Sorry. You know dogs. They go wherever they wanna go.
Gru: Unless they're dead. [laughs] I'm joking! Although, it is true. Anyway, have a good one.
Fred: Okay. Yeah.
Steamrolling whatever I see Despicable me I'm having a bad, bad day If you take it personal, that's okay Despicable me

Gru: [groans] You've got to be pulling on my leg!
Margo: Hello! Cookies for sale.
Gru: Go away. I'm not home.
Margo: Uh, yes, you are. I heard you.
Gru: [gasps] No, you didn't. This... [monotone] is a recording.
Margo: [scoffs] No, it isn't.
Gru: Yes, it is. [o.s.] Watch this. Leave a message, beep.
[Edith kicks the door]
Gru: Ow!
Agnes: Goodbye, recorded message.
Margo: [o.s.] Agnes, come on.
Gru: [screams] Kyle! Bad dog! No! No, no. Sit. My muffin.
Dr. Nefario: Gru!
Gru: Ah, Dr. Nefario.
Dr. Nefario: I know how you must be feeling. I, too, have encounteredgreat disappointment, but, in my eyes, you will always be one of the greats.
Gru: What? What happened?
Dr. Nefario: It's all over the news! Some fella just stole a pyramid. They're saying he makes all other villains look... lame.
[pause]
Gru: Assemble the minions!
Minions, assemble! Okay. Okay. Hey! Looking good, Kevin! How is the family? Good? All right. That's my Billy boy! What up, Larry? Hello, everybody! Yeah, all right! Simmer down. Simmer down! Thank you, okay. Now, I realise that you guys probably heard about this other villain who stole the pyramids. Apparently, it's a big deal. People are calling it the crime of the century and stuff like that. But am I upset? No, I am not! A little, but we have had a pretty good year ourselves, and you guys are all right in my book. No, no raises! You're not going to get any raises. What did we do? Well, we stole the Times Square JumboTron! Nice! That's how I roll. Yeah, you all like watching football on that, huh? But that's not all. We stole the Statue of Liberty, the small one from Las Vegas. And I won't even mention the Eiffel Tower! Also Vegas. Okay, I wasn't going to tell you about this yet, but I have been working on something very big! Something that will blow this pyramid thing out of the water! And thanks to the efforts of my good friend Dr Nefario... Thank you! There he is. He's styling. Now, we have located a shrink ray in a secret lab, and once we take this shrink ray, we will have the capability to pull off the true crime of the century. We are going to steal...

[The Minions all pull out their weapons]
Gru: Wait, wait! I haven't told you what it is yet.
Hey. Dave, listen up, please. Next, we are going to steal, pause for effect, the moon! And once the moon is mine, the world will give me whatever I want to get it back! And I will be the greatest villain of all time! That's what I'm talking about. Yes? Hello, Gru? I've been crunching some numbers, and I really don't see how we can afford this. It can't be done. I'm not a miracle worker. Hey, chillax. I'll just get another loan from the bank. They love me! Edith, stop it! What? I'm just walking. - Hi, Miss Hattie. We're back. - Hi, Miss Hattie. We're back. Hello, girls!

Agnes: Anybody come to adopt us while we were out?
Let me think. No! Edith! What did you put on my desk?

Edith: A mud pie.
Miss Hattie: [sighs] You're never gonna get adopted, Edith. You know that, don't you?
- Yeah, I know. - Good. So, how did it go, girls? Did we meet our quotas?

Margo: Hmm... Sort of. We sold 43 mini-mints, 30 choco-swirlies, and 18 coco-nutties.
Okay. Well, you say that like it's a great sale day. Look at my face! Do you still think it's a great sale day? Eighteen coco-nutties. I think we can do a little better than that, don't you? Yeah. We wouldn't want to spend the weekend in the Box of Shame, would we? No. - No, Miss Hattie. - No, Miss Hattie. Okay, good. Off you go. Go clean something of mine. - Hi, Penny. - Hi, Penny. Hi, guys.

Gru: Hello, Mom. Sorry, I meant to call, but...
Gru's Mom: I just wanted to congratulate you on stealing the pyramid. [Gru sighs in disgust] That was you, wasn't it? Or was it a villain who's actually successful? [laughs]
Gru: Just so you know, Mom, I am about to do something that's very, very big, very important. When you hear about it, you're going to be very proud.
Gru's Mom: Ha! [sarcastically] Good luck with that. Okay, I'm outta here.
Gru to see Mr Perkins. Yes, please have a seat. That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. Ma, someday I'm going to go to the moon. I'm afraid you're too late, Son. NASA isn't sending the monkeys any more. Hey. I'm applying for a new villain loan. Go by the name of Vector. It's a mathematical term, a quantity represented by an arrow, with both direction and magnitude. Vector! That's me, 'cause I'm committing crimes with both direction and magnitude. Oh, yeah! Check out my new weapon. Piranha gun! Oh, yes! Fires live piranhas. Ever seen one before? No, you haven't. I invented it. Do you want a demonstration? Shoot! So difficult, sometimes, to get the piranha back inside of my... Mr Gru, Mr Perkins will see you now. So, all I need is money from the bank to build a rocket. - And then, the moon is ours. - Wow! Well, very nice presentation. I'd like to see this shrink ray. Absolutely! Will do. Soon as I have it. You don't have it? And yet you have the audacity to ask the bank for money? Apparently. Do you have any idea of the capital that this bank has invested in you, Gru? With far too few of your sinister plots actually turning a profit. How can I put it? Let's say this apple is you. If we don't start getting our money back... Get the picture? Look, Gru, the point is, there are a lot of new villains out there, younger than you, hungrier than you, younger than you. Like that young fellow out there named Vector. He just stole a pyramid! I've got it. I've got it. So, as far as getting money for the rocket... Get the shrink ray, then we'll talk. Suckers! Suckers! We got it! What? Hey! Hey! What! Hey! No, no, no! You! Now, maybe you'll think twice before you freeze someone's head! So long, Gru! Quick! We can't let him get away! Up ahead! Up ahead! Fire! Fire, now! You missed me! Come to papa! Take that. How adorable. Got you in our sights! Like taking candy from a... What? Hey, Gru! Try this on for size! That's weird. What is going... This is claustrophobic! No, no, no! Too small! This is too small for me! I hate that guy! ...and please watch over us, and bless that we'll have a good night's sleep. And bless that while we're sleeping, no bugs will crawl into our ears and lay eggs in our brains. Great. Thanks for that image, Edith. And please bless that someone will adopt us soon, and that the mommy and daddy will be nice and have a pet unicorn. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Unicorns, I love them Unicorns, I love them Uni, uni, unicorns I love them Uni, unicorns, I could pet one If they were really real And they are So, I bought one so I could pet it Now it loves me Now I love it Don't you... What the... Good luck, little girls! Whoa! Cool. Hi! We're orphans from Miss Hattie's Home for Girls. - I don't care. Beat it! - Come on! We're selling cookies so, you know, we can have a better future. - Wait, wait! Do you have coco-nutties? - Yeah. Light bulb. Dr Nefario! I'm going to need a dozen tiny robots disguised as cookies! - What? - Cookie robots! - Who is this? - Oh, forget it. Well, it appears you have cleared our background check, Dr Gru. And I see you have made a list of some of your personal achievements. Thank you for that. I love reading. And I see you have been given the Medal of Honor and a knighthood. - Me, me, me. - Me, me, me. Kevin? You had your own cooking show and you can hold your breath for 30 seconds? It's not that impressive. Idiot! - Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! - Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! What in the name of... What? Well, here's the dealio. Things have been so lonely since my wife, Debbie, passed on. It's like my heart is a tooth, and it's got a cavity that can only be filled with children. I'm sorry. You are a beautiful woman. Do you speak Spanish? Do I look like I speak Spanish? You have a face como un burro. Well, thank you! Anyway, can we proceed with this adoption? So, so excited! Please tell Margo, Edith and Agnes to come to the lobby. I bet the mom is beautiful! I bet the daddy's eyes sparkle. I bet their house is made of Gummi Bears. I'm just saying it'd be nice. My caterpillar never turned into a butterfly. That's a Cheeto. Well, Debbie was a very lucky woman. Who's Debbie? Your wife. Hi, girls! Girls, I want you to meet Mr Gru. He's going to adopt you. And he's a dentist! Yeah! Hi. I'm Margo. This is Edith. And that's Agnes. I got your leg, I got your leg! Okay, that is enough, little girl. - Let go of my leg. Come on. You can do it. - Higher! - Higher! - Just release your grip. Wow! How do you remove them? Is there a command? Some nonstick spray? Crowbar? Okay, girls, let's go.

Vector: "Oh, yeah!Pretty impressive!What are you looking at?Boo-ya!You got shrunk, tiny mouthwash!Take that!You done been shrunk!Yello?I got the shrink ray, all right.No, I'm not playing with it.Gru?Don't make me laugh! No.P.S., he is not getting the moon,and P.P.S., by the time I'm done with him,he's gonna be begging for mercy.Okay, bye.Look at you, a little tiny toiletfor a little tiny baby to...
[The toilet pops out and water gets at him.]
Vector: Curse you, tiny toilet!
Gru: "Okay, here we are. Home sweet home.
Margo: So... this is, like, your house? Wait a sec... You're the guy who pretended he was a recorded message!
Gru: No, that was someone else.
Agnes: Can I hold your hand?
Gru: Uh... no.
Edith: When we got adopted by a bald guy, I thought this'd be more like Annie.
Gru: No, hey! Kyle, these are not treats. These are guests.Girls, this is Kyle, my dog.
Agnes: Fluffy doggy!
Margo: What kind of dog is that?
Gru: He is a... I don't know.
Margo: Do you really think that this is an appropriate place for little kids? 'Cause, uh... it's not.
Gru: No! No! Stay away from there!It's frag....Well, I suppose the plan will work with two.
Edith: [muffled] Hey! It's dark in here.
[Gru opens the iron maiden, revealing Edith, who spits out a straw]
Edith: It poked a hole in my juice box.
Gru: As you can see, I have provided everything a child might need. All right. Okay. As I was saying... Hey! Oh.
Edith: Somebody broke that.
Gru: "Okay, okay. Clearly, we need to set some rules. Rule number one. You will not touch anything.
Margo: Uh-huh. What about the floor?
Gru: Yes, you may touch the floor.
Margo: What about the air?
Gru: Yes, you may touch the air!
Edith: What about this?
Gru: Where did you get that?
Edith: [shrugs] Found it.
Gru: Okay. Rule number two. You will not bother me while I'm working. Rule number three. You will not cry or whine or laugh or giggle or sneeze or burp or fart! So, no, no, no annoying sounds. All right?
Agnes: "Does this count as annoying?
Gru: Very! [sighs] I will see you in six hours.
Margo: Okay, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. We're gonna be really happy here. Right? Agnes?
Question. What are these? A dozen boogie robots! Boogie! Look at this. Watch me! Cookie robots. I said cookie robots. Why are you so old? Okay. I'm on it. Hello? TV! What is that? - Look at that! - That is cool! Come on! I don't think he's a dentist. We've been working on this for a while. It's a anti-gravity serum. I meant to close that. He'll be all right, I'm sure. - Do the effects wear off? - So far, no. No, they don't. And here, of course, is the new weapon you ordered. No, no. I said "dart gun," not... Okay. Oh, yes. 'Cause I was wondering under what circumstances would we use this? But, anyway. What I really wanted to show you was this. Now those are cookie robots! La, la, la, la I love unicorns What are you doing here? I told you to stay in the kitchen! We got bored. What is this place?

Edith: Can I drink this?
Dr. Nefario: Do you want to explode? [Edith kicks him in the shin] Gru!
Gru: Get back in the kitchen!
Agnes: Will you play with us?
Gru: No.
Agnes: Why?
Gru: Because I'm busy.
Margo: [scoffs] Doing what?
Gru: Umm... Okay, okay, you got me. The dentist thing is more of a hobby. In real life, I am a spy. And it is top secret, and you may not tell anybody, because if you do...
Edith: What does this do? [fires a laser and it hits Agnes's unicorn and the burn to ashes]
Gru: Hey!
Edith: Whoops.
Agnes: My unicorn! You have to fix it.
Gru: Fix it? Look, it has been disintegrated. By definition, it cannot be fixed. [Agnes gasps in shock, then starts holding her breath] That's freaking me out. What is she doing?
Margo: She's gonna hold her breath until she gets a new one.
Gru: [sighs] It is just a toy. Now stop it! Okay, okay! I'll fix it! Tim! Mark! Phil! This is very important. You have to get the little girl a new unicorn toy. Hey, hey, hey! A toy! Go, and hurry!
What are those?
Gru: They are my cousins. Jerry! Stuart! Watch them, and keep them away from me, please.
- Wow!- Wow!
Edith: It was your cousin's idea.
Jerry: What?
Gru: Okay, bedtime.
Girls: Aww...
Minions: Aww...
Gru: Not you two!
Minions: Yay.
Gru: Okey-dokey. Beddie-bye. All tucked in. Sweet dreams.
Margo: Just so you know, you're never gonna be my dad.
Gru: I think I can live with that.
Edith: Are these beds made out of bombs?
Gru: Yes, but they are very old and highly unlikely to blow up. But try not to toss and turn.
Edith: "Cool."
Agnes: Will you read us a bedtime story?"- No.
But we can't go to sleep without a bedtime story. Well, then it's going to be a long night for you, isn't it? So, good night, sleep tight, and don't let the bed bugs bite. Because there are literally thousands of them. And there's probably something in your closet. He's just kidding, Agnes. It's beautiful. Girls, let's go. Time to deliver the cookies! Okay. But first, we're going to dance class. Actually, we're going to have to skip the dance class today. Actually, we can't skip the dance class today. We have a big recital coming up. - We're doing an excerpt from Swan Lake. - Yeah, Swan Lake! That's fantastic. Wonderful. But we're going to deliver cookies! Come on! No. No? We're not going to deliver cookies until we do dance class. Really? Well, I am not driving you to dance class. So if you want to go, you are going to have to walk yourselves. What are you doing? Walking to dance class. Ya? Okay, fine. You just keep walking, because I'm really not driving you! Okay. You're going to suffer the wrath of Gru! Seriously, I'm going to count to three! And you had better be in this car! Here we go! One! Two! ...three, four and five. And lift, and stretch. And one, and two... - Here you go. - What is it? Your ticket to the dance recital. You are coming, right? Of course, of course. I have pins and needles that I'm sitting on. Pinkie promise? Oh, yes. My pinkie promises. All right. Our first customer is a man named Vector. But he's a V. You know, we're supposed to start with the A's. Then we go to the B's. Then we... Yes, yes! I went to kindergarten. I know how the alphabet works! I was just thinking that it might be nice to deliver Mr Vector's first. That is all. Almost over. It's almost over. Girls, welcome back to the fortress of Vector-tude! Do you have my cookies for me? Four boxes of mini-mints, two toffee totes, two caramel clumpies and fifteen boxes of coco-nutties. Exactly. I'd like to see somebody else order that many cookies. Not likely. Name one person who ordered more cookies than me. That'll be $52. Right. Seven, eight, nine... Tic Tacs! Where was I? Seven, eight, nine... Why are you wearing pyjamas? These aren't pyjamas! This is a warm-up suit. - What are you warming up for? - Stuff. What sort of stuff? Super-cool stuff you wouldn't understand. Like sleeping? They are not pyjamas! Here you go, 52 big ones. Bye! Come on! What the... Quiet down, fish! Down, boy!

Gru: [laughs] We did it! Come on, girls, let's go!
Margo: But what about the other people who ordered cookies?
Gru: Life is full of disappointments for some people. [chuckles ominously]
Agnes: (Screams).
Gru: Don't do that!
Agnes: Super Silly Fun Land! Can we go? Please?
Gru: No.
Edith: But we've never been. And it's the funnest place on earth!
Gru: "Don't care."
All: Please? Please?
We'll never ask for anything else, ever again! - Pretty please? - Please? - Come on! - Come on!

Gru: "Light bulb."
Come on!
Gru: "Goodbye, have fun.
Sorry, dude. They can't ride without an adult.

Gru: What? [groans]
Agnes: Oh, my gosh! Look at that fluffy unicorn! He's so fluffy, I'm gonna die!
You've gotta let us play for it! No, no, no. Come on! How much for the fluffy unicorn? Well, it is not for sale. But all you gotta do to win it is knock down that little spaceship there. It's easy! Yay! Again! - Wait! - Come on. One more time! Just one more. I accidentally closed my eyes. - I hit it! I hit it! - That was cool. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What was that? She hit that. I saw that with my own eyes. Hey, buddy, let me explain something to you. You see that little tin spaceship? You see how it's not knocked over? Do you know what that means, professor? It means you don't get the unicorn! Somebody's got a frowny face. Boo! Better luck next time! Okay, my turn.

Gru: "Knocked over!"- It's so fluffy!
- Yeah! That was awesome! You blew up the whole thing! Let's go. Let's try another game! Gru, do you mind if I have a quick word? Okay, girls, go play. I got the shrink ray! Cotton candy! We have 12 days until the moon is in optimum position. We can't afford any distractions! Get me Perkins. Sorry to bother you, Mr Perkins, but I figured that you would want to see this! What? Well done, Gru. Rather impressive.

Gru: Now, the rest of the plan is simple. I fly to the moon. I shrink the moon. I grab the moon. I sit on the toi-let. What? Sorry. Sorry! Could you excuse me for just one second? I told you not to touch my things. I told you, I told you. I've told you a thousand times.
Hey, can we order pizza? Pizza? You just had lunch. Not now, for dinner. Dinner? Just... Fine, fine, fine, whatever. Just get back in there! Can we get stuffed crust? - Stuffed crust! - Stuffed crust!

Gru: I'll stuff you all in the crust!
Agnes: [giggles] You're funny!
Gru: Just don't come out of that room again! All right. Sorry about that. Where were we?
Mr. Perkins: You were sitting on the toilet.
Gru: No, no, no! No, I'm sorry. It was a little attempt at humor. I know how much you like to laugh... [Mr. Perkins glares at him] inside. Eh, now, I was saying...
[the door suddenly opens]
You don't seem terribly focused, Gru. Believe me, I am completely focused. - Hello! - What? That guy is huge! - Are we on TV? - What are those? Children?

Gru: What are you doing? I told you to stay out of here!
No, no, no! Freeze ray! Mr Gru? Okay. As I was saying... No need to continue. I've seen quite enough. - But my plan... - Is a great plan. I love everything about your plan, except for one thing. You. Look, Mom, I drew a picture of me landing on the moon! Look, Mom, I made a prototype of the rocket out of macaroni! Look, Mom, I made a real rocket based on the macaroni prototype! I don't understand. Let's face reality, Gru. You've been at this for far too long with far too little success. We're gonna put our faith, our money, into a... Well, a younger villain. But I... It's over. Goodbye, Gru. Now, I know there have been some rumours going around that the bank is no longer funding us. Well, I am here to put those rumours to rest. They are true. In terms of money, we have no money. So how will we get to the moon? The answer is clear. We won't. We are doomed. Now would probably be a good time to look for other employment options. I know. I have fired up my resume as I suggest that all of you do, as well. What is it? Can't you see that I am in the middle of a pep talk? Yes! Yes, we will build our own rocket using this and whatever else we can find! Grab everything! Hit the junkyards! Take apart the cars! Who needs the bank? Let's go. Let's go! Mom! What are you doing here? And here he is in the bathtub. Look at his little buns. Mom. Not cool. And here, he's all dressed up in his Sunday best. He looks like a girl! Yes, he does. An ugly girl! You're funny! Yes! Mine's shaped like a dead guy! Mr Perkins, your son is here. Send him in. Hey, Dad. You wanted to see me? - Yes, I did, Victor. - I am not Victor anymore. Victor was my nerd name. Now I am Vector! Sit down! Do you know where the shrink ray is? Duh! Back at my place. Oh, is that right? Back at your place? That's cool. I guess Gru must just have one that looks exactly like it! What the... Those girls sold me cookies! Do you have any idea how lucrative this moon heist could be? I give you the opportunity of a lifetime, and you just blow it! - No, I didn't. - Oh, really?

Vector: You just wait until Gru sees my latest weapon. Squid-launcher! Oh, yeah!
There's a squid on my face!

Vector: Don't worry. The moon is as good as ours.
Gru: Come on now, it's bedtime. Did you brush your teeth? Let me smell. Let me smell. You did not! Put on your PGs. Hold still. Okay, seriously! Seriously! This is beddie-bye time, right now. I'm not kidding around. I mean it!
- But we're not tired! - Well, I am tired.

Agnes: Will you read us a bedtime story?
[pause]
Gru: No.
Agnes: Pretty please?
Gru: The physical appearance of the "please" makes no difference. It is still no, so go to sleep.
Edith: But we can't. We're all hyper!
Margo: And without a bedtime story, we'll just keep getting up and bugging you. All night long.
Gru: [sighs] Fine.
All right, all right. Sleepy Kittens. Sleepy Kittens? - What are these? - Puppets. You use them when you tell the story. Okay, let's get this over with. "Three little kittens loved to play, they had fun in the sun all day. "Then their mother came out and said, 'Time for kittens to go to bed."' Wow! This is garbage. You actually like this? Keep reading! - Come on! - All right, all right, all right. "Three little kittens started to bawl, "'Mommy, we're not tired at all.' "Their mother smiled and said with a purr, "'Fine, but at least you should brush your fur."' Now you brush the fur. This is literature? A 2-year-old could have written this. All right. "Three little kittens with fur all brushed "said, 'We can't sleep, we feel too rushed! ' "Their mother replied, with a voice like silk, "'Fine, but at least you should drink your milk."' Now make them drink the milk. I don't like this book. This is going on forever. "Three little kittens, with milk all gone, rubbed their eyes and started to yawn. "'We can't sleep, we can't even try.' Then their mother sang a lullaby. "'Good night kittens, close your eyes. Sleep in peace until you rise. "'Though while you sleep, we are apart, "'your mommy loves you with all her heart."' The end. Okay, good night. - Wait! - What? What about good night kisses? No, no. There will be no kissing or hugging or kissing. He is not gonna kiss us good night, Agnes. I like him. He's nice.

Edith: [turns off her light] But scary.
Like Santa! Only 48 hours till the launch, and all systems are go. About that, I was thinking that maybe we could move the date of the heist. Please tell me this is not as a result of the girls' dance recital, is it? No, no, no! The recital? Don't... That's stupid! I just think it's kind of weird to do it on a Saturday. I was thinking, maybe a heist is a Tuesday thing, right? Gru, you and I have been working on this for years. It's everything we've dreamed of. Your chance to make history, become the man who stole the moon! But these girls are becoming a major distraction! They need to go. If you don't do something about it, then I will. I understand. Good. Butt. Butt. Butt. All right. Now, when we put our cups together, we will make the "clink" sound with our mouths. Ready? Edith? - Clink. - Clink. There we go. And now we drink. And Agnes? - Clink. - Clink. Very good! Excuse me, girls. Come on! Don't worry, I'll be back. Keep clinking. - Clink, clink. - Clink, clink.

Gru: Miss Hattie, what are you doing here?
Miss Hattie: I'm here for the girls. I received a call that you wanted to return them. [Gru gives her a quizzical look] And also, I did purchase a Spanish dictionary. [swats Gru's head with the dictionary] I didn't like what you said.
Gru: But...
I will get the girls ready.

Agnes: Don't let her take us, Mr. Gru! Tell her you wanna keep us.
All right, girls. Come on, let's go. Goodbye, Mr Gru. Thanks for everything. I did it for your own good. Come on, let's go get that moon. Right. What is this for? The recital? I am the greatest criminal mind of the century. I don't go to little girls' dance recitals! Opening launch bay doors. Commencing launch sequence. And we are good to go in T minus 10 seconds. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... Oh, yeah! Nice work, Doctor. All systems go. Boo-ya! My flight suit. Oh, yeah! Once again, the mighty... I've got it! I've got the moon! I've got the moon! I can make it! - Wait a minute! - Kevin! Come on, come on! He's still not here. Why would he come? He gave us up. But he pinkie promised! Girls, girls, places! No, we can't start yet! We're still expecting someone. Can we just wait a few more minutes? All right. But just a few more minutes. He's not coming, guys. Gru! Gru, can you hear me? Quick, we have to warn him, and fast!

Gru: Okay, okay. There's the library. That's Third Street. The dance studio... There! There! There it is!
Sorry, buddy. Show's over.

Gru: Over?
Vector, open up! First give me the moon. Then we'll talk. - Mr Gru! - Zip it, Happy Meal. Now, the girls.

Vector: Actually, I think I'll hold on to them a little while longer.
Gru: No!
Vector: Oh, yeah! Unpredictable!
Gru: Listen close, you little punk. When I get in there, you are in for a world of pain!
Vector: [laughs sarcastically] I'm really scared!
He is gonna kick your butt. What? He punched my shark! There he is! Hang on, Gru. Oh, no! Vector has the girls. Go! What happened to the ship? It's big again! - Not as big as the moon is going to be! - What? The larger the mass of an object, the quicker the effects of the shrink ray wear off! I call it the Nefario Principle. I just came up with it now, actually. Oh, no! Did you see that? - Vector! Help! - Vector! - Over here! - Hey! What are you girls doing back there? The moon! Watch out! Get as close in as you can. You got it. - Mr Gru, up here! - Mr Gru! Okay, girls! Girls! - You're going to have to jump. - Jump? Are you insane? Don't worry, I will catch you. You gave us back! I know, I know. And it is the worst mistake I ever made. But you have to jump now. It'll be okay. Okay, girls. Jump now! Margo, I will catch you. And I will never let you go again. - Not so fast! - No! Let me go! Margo! I'm coming, Margo. Hang on! I got you. No! Oh, poop.

News Reporter: This time, good triumphs, and the moon has been returned to its rightful place in the sky. But once again, law enforcement is baffled, leaving everyone to wonder, who is this mysterious hero? And what will he do next?
Okay, girls. Time for bed. - Come on! We want a story. - Three sleepy kittens! Oh, no! Sorry. That book was accidentally destroyed maliciously. Tonight we are going to read a new book. This one is called One Big Unicorn by... Who wrote this? Me! I wrote it. Look, it's a puppet book! Here, watch this. That's the horn! This is gonna be the best book ever! Not to pat myself on the back, but, yes, it probably will be. Here we go. "One big unicorn, strong and free "thought he was happy as he could be. "Then three little kittens came around "and turned his whole life upside down." Hey, that one looks like me! No, what are you talking about? These are kittens! Any relation to persons living or dead is completely coincidental. "They made him laugh. "They made him cry. "He never should have said goodbye. "And now he knows he could never part "from those three little kittens "that changed his heart. "The end." Okay, all right. Good night. I love you. I love you, too. No, no! All right. Didn't I get you already? They're very good! I'm so proud of you, Son. You've turned out to be a great parent! Just like me. Maybe even better. No, I'm fine. Go ahead. No, no, no! THE END Hey, Carl! Hey. No, no, no. Me, me, me. John? No, no. Me, me, me. Oh, poop. Oh, no! Stop! Stop! Hello, I am Gru. Back to work, back to work! Back to...

Worker#1: Hey, Larry, where's the forklift? ( To worker#2 who is
busy guiding a plane into a hanger )
Worker#2: Forklift? Its over there by the baggage loader.
( Gestures the direction of baggage loader with
guide sticks causing the plane to go that direction
and to come crashing into the terminal)
People : ( In terminal ) LOOK OUT!!!! ARGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!
(pandemonium).
Striker : Elaine!!!!!
Elaine : Ted!
Striker : I came home early and found your note. I guess you
meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to
to talk to you.
Elaine : I just don't want to go over it anymore.
Striker : I know things haven't been right for a long time,
but... It'll be different. Like it was in the
beginning. If you'll just be patient I can work
things out.
Elaine : I have been patient and I tried to help, but you
wouldn't even let me do that.
Striker : Don't you feel anything for me at all anymore?
Elaine : It takes so many things to make love last. But,
most of all, it takes respect, and I can't live
with the man I don't respect.
Striker : ( To camera ) What a PISSER!
PA : Captain Oever, white courtesy phone. Captain Cla
rence
Oever, white courtesy phone.
OEVER PICKS UP A RED PHONE.
Operator: NO! THE WHITE PHONE.
Oever : Oh! ( picks up white phone ) This is Captain Oever!
Operator: One moment for your call from the Mayo Clinic.
PA : Captain Oever, white courtesy phone. Captain Clarence
Oever, white courtesy phone.
Oever : I'VE GOT IT!
PA : Thank you.
Operator: Go ahead with your call.
MayoDoct: Uh, this is Doctor Brody at the Mayo Clinic. There's a
passenger on your Chicago flight 209er, a little girl
named Lisa Davis, en route to Minneapolis. She's
scheduled for a heart transplant, we'd like you to tell
her mother we found a donor an hour ago. We have the
heart here, ready for surgery. . . We must have the
recipient on the operating table within 6 hours. I
want you to make sure she's kept in a reclined position
and that a continuous watch is kept on her IV. Also,
its very important that she remain calm. . .
Operator: EXCUSE ME, This is the operator Captain Oever, I have
an emergency call on line 5 from a Mr. Hamm.
Oever : Alright, Give me Hamm on 5, hold the Mayo.
Striker : Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night, we'll...
have dinner. We'll talk things over.
Elaine : I won't be back, I've requested the Atlanta run.
Striker : Elaine, I promise, I can change.
Elaine : Then why didn't you take the job that Louis Neds
offered you at Boeing?
Striker : You know I haven't been able to get near a plane since
since the war. Even if I could, they wouldn't hire
me because of my war record.
Elaine : You're war record ??? You're the only one keeping that
alive, for everyone else, its ancient history.
Striker : You expect me to believe that?
Elaine : Its the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record
since the war. Different cities, different jobs and
not one of them shows you can accept any real
responsibility.
Striker : Elaine, if you just give me one more . . .
Elaine : Its too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm
going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.
Zealot#4: Excuse me, we'd like you to have this flower from the
Church of Religious Conscious. . .PUNCH . . .

Attendnt: Hi! Well, good evening. Oh, there you go.
You just follow all the way back. Hello.
Victor : Any word on that storm lifting over Salt Lake
Clarence?
Oever : No not likely, Victor. I just reviewed the area report
for 1600 hours through 2400.
Victor : Uh, huh ...
Oever : There's a front stalled over the Dakotas, backed all
the way to Utah.
Victor : Yeah, well, if she decides to push over to the great
lakes, it could get plenty slippery.
Oever : Uh, huh.
Victor : What about the southern route, around Tulsa?
Oever : I double checked the terminal forecast and winds aloft
and I had cloudy ceilings all the way.
Victor : Where do they top out?
Oever : Well . . . there's some light scattered cover to 20,000
icing around 15. . .
Worker3 : Wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..
(falling off ladder from washing plane's windows)
Victor : Boy looks like the original plan ought to be the

Oever : Good evening ladies and gentleman, this is Captain
Oever speaking. Well, be cruising at 36,000 feet
this evening. Our arrival time in Chicago will be
10:45 pm central time. The temperature there is
currently 62 degrees with a 20% chance of precipitation.
Meanwhile, relax and enjoy your flight.
Elaine : Would you like something to read?
Oldlady: Do you have anything light?
Elaine : Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh... how about this leaflet, famous Jewish
sports legends?
Oldlady: Yes, thank you.
Elaine : Teeeeeeeeeeeed!?! What are you doing here?
Striker: Elaine, I've got to talk to you!
Elaine : Y-Y-Yo-You shouldn't have come, I don't have time now!
Oldlady: Stewardess . . .
Elaine : Excuse me!
Oldlady: No wonder you're upset! She's lovely! And a darling
figure. Supple pouting breasts. . . firm thighs . . .
its a shame you two don't get along.
Striker: Yes, I know, things used to be different. I remember
when we first met. It was during the war. ( Flashback)
I was in the Air Force stationed in Drambui, off the
Barbary coast. I used to hang out at the Magumba bar.
It was a rough place, the seediest dive on the wharf.
Populated with every reject and cut-throat from Bombay
to Calcutta. Its worse than Detroit. The mood in the
place was downright ugly. You wouldn't walk in there
unless you knew how to use your fists. You could count
on a fight breaking out almost every night. ( fight
between two women breaks out. Chairs are crashed . . .)
( Saturday Night Fever music starts to play when juke
box is clobbered I didn't go there that night to fall
in love I just dropped in for a couple of drinks. But,
suddenly there she was. I was captivated, entranced.
It hit me like a thunderbolt. I had to ask the
guy next to me to pinch me to make sure I wasn't
dreaming. I was afraid to approach her, but that
night fate was on my side. ( The man Elaine is dancing
with gets a knife in his back. He tries to ascertain
help from Elaine by pointing with both hands at his
back, but Elaine thinks that this is a new dance move
and mimics him. He collapses and dies. Striker begins
to dance disco style with Elaine, soon a crowd gathers
to watch. Both Ted and Elaine dance in humanly
impossible ways. The crowd cheers. Next the bar is
empty, and its the end of the night. Ted and Elaine
are still there with the 2 fighting women. ( end
flashback ) We laughed, we talked, we danced I never
wanted it to end. I guess I still don't. But, enough
about me, I hope this hasn't been boring for you. Its
just that whenever I talk about Elaine, I get so carried
away, I loose all track of time. ( Oldlady has hung
herself )
Elaine : Would you like to order dinner now?
Father : Yes, Joey will have the steak and my wife and I will
have the fish.
Joey : When can I see the cockpit dad?
Father : Joey, I think the pilots are probably too busy flying
the plane for that.
Joey : Awww, geee whiz!!!!!!!!!!
Elaine : I'll tell you what Joey, I'll talk to the Captain and
see what I can arrange.
Joey : Gee, that'd be swell!
Elaine : Would you gentleman care to order your dinners?
Jiveman1: Bet babe, slide a piece a da porter, drink si' run th'
java.
Subtitle: I WOULD LIKE THE STEAK PLEASE.
Jiveman2: Lookie here, I can dig grease and butter on some
draggin' fruit garden.
Subtitle: I'LL HAVE THE FISH.
littlboy: Excuse me, I happened to be passing and I thought you
might like some coffee.
littgirl: Oh, that's very nice of you. Thank you. Oh, won't you
sit down?
Littlboy: Oh thank you. Cream?
Littgirl: No thank you, I take it black . . . . . . like my men.
Striker : Well, you see . . . ( to a different passenger --
new flashback, reminiscent of the Blue Lagoon. )
Elaine : Oh TED! I never knew I could be so happy. These
few months have been just wonderful. Tomorrow,
why don't we drive up the coast to that little
seafood place and . . . what's the matter???
Striker : My orders came through. My squadron ships out
tomorrow, we're bombing the storage depots at
Daiquiri at 18:00 hours. We're coming in from the
North, below their radar.
Elaine : When will you be back?
Striker : I can't tell you that? It's classified.
Elaine : Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
Striker : I love you Elaine.
Elaine : I love you!
( Return from flashback, the passenger stabs himself to death )
Denver : Flight 2-0-9er, this is Denver flight control. You are
approaching some rough weather. Please climb to 42,000
feet.
Oever : Roger, Denver.
Elaine : We have a visitor. . .
Oever : Hello.
Murdock : Hi!
Elaine : This is Captain Oever, Mr Murdock and Mr Basta. This
is Joey Hammond. . .
Oever : Well hi Joey.
Murdock : Come on up here, you can see better.
Oever : We have something here for our special visitors ( takes
out a model airplane for Joey ), would you like to have
it?
Joey : Thank youuuuuuu! Thanks alot!
Oever : Sure. You ever been in a cockpit before?
Joey : No sir, I've never been up in a plane before.
Oever : You ever . . . seen a grown man naked ?
Murdock : Do you want me to check the weather Clarence?
Oever : No, why don't you take care of it. Joey, did ya
ever hang around a gymnasium?
Elaine : We'd better get back now Joey!
Oever : Noooooooo, Joey can stay here for a while if he'd
like.
Joey : Could I?
Elaine : Okay, if you don't get in the way.
Murdock : Flight 2-0-9er to Denver radio, climbing to cruise
at 42,000. Will report again over Lincoln. Over and
out.
Joey : Wait a minute! I know you. You're Kareem Abdul-Jabar.
You played basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Murdock : I'm sorry son, but you must have me confused with some-
one else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
Joey : You are Kareem! I've seen you play. My dad's got
season tickets.
Murdock : I think you should go back to your seat now Joey.
Right Clarence?
Oever : Nahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, he's not bothering anyone, let him
stay here.
Murdock : But just remember, my name is ROGER MURDOCK. I'm an
airline pilot.
Joey : I think you're the greatest, but my dad says you don't
work hard enough on defence. And he says that lots of
times, you don't even run down court. And that you
don't really try . . . except during the playoffs.
Murdock : The hell I don't!! ( grabs joey by collar ) LISTEN KID!
I've been hearing that crap ever since I was at UCLA.
I'm out there busting my buns every night. Tell your
old man to drag Walton and Denier up and down the
court for 48 minutes.
Oever : Joey, do you like movies about gladiators?
Striker : Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been
right for a long time, but it'll be different. like
it was in the beginning, remember?
Elaine : I remember everything. All I have are memories.
Mostly, I remember the nights when we were together.
I remember how you used to hold me and... how I used
to sit on your face and wiggle and...afterwards how
we'd watch 'til the sun came up. When it did, it was
almost like . . . like . . . each new day was made
only for us.
Striker : That's the way I've always wanted it to be Elaine.
Elaine : But it won't be . . . not as long as you insist on
living in the past.
( Striker flashes back -- )
Voice: You're too low Ted . . . YOU'RE TOO LOW!
( Now in military mental hospital. Random mental hospital
conversation has been skipped. Striker is painting a picture of
a guy in the middle of an explosion )
Doctor : Okay Robert, slip em down, this won't hurt much . .
Elaine : You got a telegram from headquarters today.
Striker: HEADQUARTERS?!? What is it?
Elaine : Well, its a big building where generals meet. But
that's not important right now. They've cleared
you of any blame for what happened in that raid.
Isn't that good news?
Striker: Is it? Because of my mistake 6 men didn't return
from that raid.
Elaine : 7, Lieutenant Zip died this morning. . . ( Striker
spits out drink ) The Doctor says you'll be out in
a week, isn't that wonderful?
Striker: Wish I could say the same for George Zip.
Elaine : Be patient Ted, nobody expects you to get over this
immediately.
Subject: Hey Striker, How bout a break, I'm getting tired.
Striker: Yeah, alright. Take 5. ( We see that the subject
has been standing in a contorted stance with an
explosion backdrop exactly mimicking the painting
Striker has been working on )
Elaine: I have found a wonderful apartment for us. It has
a brick fireplace and a cute little bedroom with
mirrors on the ceiling and . . .
Jeleen: Red leader, Red Leader . . . I'm goin' down (
makes gunner noises )
Striker: Captain Jeleen. He thinks he's a pilot still
fighting the war.
Jeleen : I've found the tunnel Johnson!! Its this way $25
for a cigarette is too much!
Herwitz: Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.... uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...
Elaine : What's his problem?
Striker: Its Lt. Herwitz. Severe shell shock. Thinks he's
Ethel Merman.
( We cut back to herwitz, but he is now replaced with the
real Ethel Merman )
Herwitz: You'lllllll be swell...
You'll be great...
Gonna have the whole world on a plate.
Startin' here.
Startin' now.
Honey, everything's coming up rosseehhhhhhhhsss.
( He ( she ) faints )
Striker: War is hell.
( Meanwhile back on the plane )
Attendnt: Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
Striker : No, no thank you.
Attendnt: Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
Mother2 : I will, but Jim won't.
Father : I think I will have another cup of coffee.
Mother2 : ( To herself in an echo voice ) Jim never has a
second cup at home.
Attendnt: Excuse me sister . . .
Nun : Yeahhhs?
Attendnt: There's little girl on board up front who's ill and ..
Nun : Oh, yes. I saw, poor child.
Attendnt: Could I borrow your guitar . . . I think maybe I could
cheer her up.
Nun : Of course.
Attendnt: Ohhhh.... thank you. ( She drags guitar across the
passengers heads )
Attendnt: Hi!
Mother : Hi!
Attendnt: Do you mind if I talk to your daughter?
Mother : No I think that'd be nice.
Attendnt: Hi, I'm Randy.
Dyingirl: I'm Lisa . . . YOU HAVE A GUITAAAAR!
Attendnt: Uh, huh! I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Dyingirl: I'd love too!
Attendnt: Okay. Let's see, uh... this is one of my favorites!
I've traveled the banks of the river of Jordan
To find where it flows to the sea
I looked in the eyes of the cold and the hungry
And I saw that I was looking at meeeeeee.
And I wanted to know if life had a purpose
And what it all means in the end
In the silence I listened to voices inside me
And they told me again and again.
There is only one river ( Knocks IV out of Lisa's
arm with guitar but doesn't notice )
There is only one sea
And it flows through you
And it flows through me ( Lisa is having conniptions
about her IV as if about to die )
There is only one people
We are one in the same ( The whole plane begins to
clap along )
We are all one spirit
One naaaaaaaaaaaammmme.
We are the father
We are one.
We are one.
We are one.
Oever : Little late tonight. We've been waiting for you.
Elaine : Who wants to be first?
Murdock : Go ahead Clarence, I got 'er.
Elaine : How's the weather?
Murdock : Not so good. We've got some heavy stuff ahead of us.
It might get rough again unless we can climb on top.
Striker : ( To a guy in a turban ) Yeah, after the war, I just
wanted to get as far away from things as possible.
Elaine and I joined the Peace Corps. We were assigned
to an isolated tribe: the Malumbos. ( Flashback to
African tribe ) They'd never seen Americans before.
Striker : It was really a challenge during the year
introducing them to our western culture.
At first they didn't know what to think
of us, but soon we gained their trust.
Elaine : It will help you better prepare and store
foods for the up and coming Monsoon months.
Also, Supperware products are ideal for storing
leftovers to help stretch your food dollar. This
2 quart Sealz-em Right container will keep hot dog
buns fresh for days.
Striker : You must understand, these people had been
completely isolated from civilization. No one
had ever outlined a physical fitness program
for them and they had no athletic equipment.
I started them on simple calisthenics and slowly
worked them up to rudimentary game skills. And
finally, advanced competitive theory. I was
patient with them and they were eager to learn.
they seemed to enjoy themselves. It was probably
due to the advanced American techniques that we
were able to bridge the generations of isolation
communicate so successfully with Mulambos.
( The Mulambos start to play basketball like pros)
I think they're finally getting the hang of it
when we re-enlist, I'll teach them baseball.
Elaine : Ted, I don't want to stay here, its time for us
to go back home to the plans we made before the
war.
Striker : Alot of people made plans before the war . . .
like George Zip. It was at that moment that I
first realized Elaine had doubts about our
relationship. And that as much as anything else
led to my drinking problem ( He pours his drink
on himself.) We did come back to the states, I tried
a number of jobs . . . well, I could go on for hours,
but I would probably start to bore you. ( Guy in
turban pulls out knife and points it to his heart )
I really couldn't blame Elaine ( Guy stabs himself
and moans ) she wanted a career.
Oldlady2: Uhhhhhhhh...... I can't stand it. Ohhhhhhh.
Elaine : Yes?
Oldlady2: Oh... its my stomach. I haven't felt this aweful since
we saw that Ronald Reagan film. uhh.
Elaine : I'll see if I can find some Dramamine. ( Goes to
cockpit ) Captain, one of the woman passengers is
very sick.
Oever : Airsick?
Elaine : I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Oever : Find out if there's a doctor on board as quietly as
you can. . . Joey . . . have you ever been in a, a
Turkish prison?
Father : Ohhhhhhhhhh, I shouldn't have had that second cup of
coffee. ( he vomits )
Mother2 : ( In echo voice ) Jim never vomits at home.
Elaine : I'm sorry I had to wake you, I'm just looking for a
doctor, there's nothing to worry about.
Woman3 : Stewardess, I think the man sitting next to me is
a Doctor.
Elaine : Sir, excuse me sir, I am sorry I have to wake you,
sir, are you a doctor?
Rumack : That's right.
Elaine : We have some passengers that are very sick, could you
come take a look at them?
Rumack : Yes, of course. . . ( To sick woman ) Let me see your
tongue. ( eggs begin to come out of her mouth. Rumack
cracks one and a bird flys out ) I'll be back in a
minute. ( To Elaine )
You'd better tell the Captain we've got to land as soon
as possible, we've got to get them to the hospital. . .
Elaine : A hospital . . what is it?
Rumack : Its a big building with patients, but that's not
important right now. Tell the captain I must speak
to him.
Elaine : Certainly.
( Victor is getting sick )
Oever : Victor, we're running into some heavy weather . . .
can you ( Victor passes out ) Roger! Take OVER!
Rumack : Captain, how soon can you land?
Oever : I can't tell.
Rumack : You can tell me, I'm a doctor.
Oever : NO, I mean I'm just not sure.
Rumack : Well, can't you take a guess?
Oever : Well, not for another 2 hours.
Rumack : You can't take a guess for another 2 hours?
Oever : No, no, no. I mean we can't land for another 2 hours
fog has closed down everything this side of the
mountains. We've got to get through to Chicago.
????????: What is it doctor?
Rumack : I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since
the Anita Bryant concert. What was it we had for
dinner tonight?
Elaine : Well, we had a choice, steak or fish.
Rumack : Yes, yes, I remember, I had lasagna. What did he
have?
Elaine : Fish . . .
Attendnt: Doctor, there are 2 more sick people and the rest of
the passengers are worried.
Rumack : I'll go take care of the passengers. Find out what the
two sick people had for dinner.
Oever : This is Captain Oever speaking, been a little bumpy up
here, but we'll be past it in a couple minutes. A few
points of interest we are now flying over Hoover damn
and a little later on, we'll pass just to the south of
the Grand Canyon. Meanwhile, relax and enjoy your
flight, okay? CHICAGO: THIS IS FLIGHT 2-0-9er. . .
We're in trouble, we've got to have all traffic below
us cleared. I want a priority approach and landing in
Chicago.
Mother2: Stewardess, my husband is very sick can you do
something please?
Elaine : Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment.
One thing, do you know what he had for dinner?
Mother2 : Yes, of course, we both had fish. Why?
Elaine : Oh, its nothing to be alarmed about. We'll be back to
you very quickly.
Elaine : Dr Rumack, Mr Hammond ate fish, and Randy said there
five more cases and they all had fish too.
Rumack : And the Co-Pilot had fish, what did the navigator have?
Elaine : He had fish.
Rumack : Alright, now we know what we're up against. Every
passenger on this flight who had fish for dinner will
become violently ill in the next half hour ( Oever
notices he had fish and begins to come down with the
symptoms as they are described )
Elaine : Just how serious is it Doctor?
Rumack : Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever and
dryness of the throat. When the virus penetrates the
red blood cells, the victim becomes dizzy begins to
experience an itchy rash, then the poison goes to work
on the central nervous system, severe muscle spasms
followed by the inevitable grueling. At this point,
the entire digestive system collapses accompanied by
uncontrollable flatulence ( Oever begins to fart )
Until finally, the poor bastard is reduced to a
quivering wasted piece of jelly.
Oever : Au--to--ma-tic pi-lot.
Elaine : ( Searches for button ) Automatic pilot, automatic
pilot, there it is . . . ( Otto begins to inflate)
Rumack : I'll go back to the passengers.
Chicago : Come in 2-0-9er, this is Chicago. Flight 2-0-9er,
come in.
Elaine : This is Elaine Dickenson, I'm the stewardess,
Captain Oever has passed out on the floor and
the co-pilot and navigator too. We're in
terrible trouble, over.
MCrosky : Roger, Elaine, Roger. I read you. This is Steve
McCrosky at Chicago air control, Back to you in
a minute ( To Tower ) Hold all takeoffs, I don't
want another plane in the air. When the 508
reports, bring it straight in. Put out a general
bulletin to suspend meal service on flights out
of Los Angeles. Tell all dispatchers to remain at
their posts, its gonna be long night. How bout
some coffee Johnny?
Johnny : NO THANKS!
MCrosky : I want the weather on every landing field this side
of the line, no matter what the size. Do you
understand? Anyplace, anyplace where there's a
chance to land that plane. ( To Siamese twins )
Stan, go up stairs to the tower and get a runway
diagram. Terry, check down the field for emergency
equipment.
Airdude : Chief we got fog right down to the deck, every
place east of the Rockies. There's no possible
place to land, they'll have to come through to
Chicago.
MCrosky : Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit smoking.
I want the best available man on this, a man who
knows that plane inside and out and won't crack
under pressure.
Johnny : How 'bout Mr Rogers?
MCrosky : Get me REX KRAMER! Elaine, right next to the throttle
is the air speed gauge. What speed does it indicate?
Elaine : 520 miles per hour.
MCrosky : Good now, check your altitude. That's the dial just
below and to the right of the air speed indicator.
Elaine : 35,000 feet. NO wait, 34,000 feet . . . NO WAIT,
its dropping. Its dropping fast, why's it doing
that? Oh my god, the automatic pilot, its
deflating.
MCrosky : Don't panic, on the belt line of the automatic pilot
there's a tube, now that is the manual inflation
nozzle. Take it out and blow on it.
Passngr : What the hell's going on up there?
Rumack : Elaine?
Elaine : Yes, Doctor.
Rumack : Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face
a few unpleasant facts?
Elaine : NO.
Rumack : Alright, unless I get those people to a hospital
quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives.
Now, is there anyone on board who can land this
plane?
Elaine : Well, no, no one I know of.
Rumack : I think you ought to know what are chances are. The
life of everyone on board depends on one thing:
finding someone on board who can not only fly this
plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
Elaine : Ladies and gentleman, this is your stewardess speaking
We regret any inconvenience the sudden cabin movement
might have caused this is due to periodic airpockets we
encountered. There's no reason to be alarmed and we hope
you enjoy the rest of your flight. By the way, is there
anyone on board who knows how to fly a plane?
( PANDEMONIUM ENSUES, EVERYONE RUNS EVERYWHERE . . .)
( Back at Rex's house )
Paul : Hello, I am Paul Puree from the airline, I'm here to
pick up Captain Kramer.
MsKramer: Oh, yes come in Paul, Rex will be right out.
Dog : Ruff, Ruff ( starts to grab paul's leg)
MsKramer: Shep, sit. So, I understand you all have a real
emergency down there.
Paul : Yes, something like that, but as I said, they didn't
have time to ( tries to get dog off leg ) tell me
very much. Ahhhh.
MsKramer: Shep, no. I'll bet you have exciting things happen all
the time down there.
Paul : Well, the airline business does have its moments ( still
trying to get rid of dog ) but after a while you get
used to it.
MsKramer: Shep! Come. He gets so excited when new people are
here. Are you a pilot yourself?
Paul : NO, (ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh) I am in a training program. . .
Kramer : Its unbelievable, just unbelievable, you know how many
times I've warned them about food inspection.
MsKramer: You'd think after all these years someone would listen
to you ( dog and Paul wrestling in background)
Kramer : Airport management, the FAA and the airlines. They're
all cheats and liars. Alright, lets get outta here.
Attndnt : I'm sorry to bother you, I was just looking for someone
with flying experience.
Striker : When they built those roads they had no thought of
drainage in mind, so we had to take a special jeep
up to the main road. In fact, we were lucky to even
get a jeep since just the day before the only one we
had broke down, had a bad axle. ( The passenger
next to him douses himself in gasoline and lights
a match, then pauses while stewardess talks to
Striker )
Attndnt : Excuse me sir, there's been a little problem in the
cockpit . . .
Striker : The cockpit . . . what is it?
Attndnt : Its the little room in the front of the plane where the
pilots sit, but that's not important now. You see the
first officer is ill and the Captain need someone to
help him with the radio. Do you know anything about
planes?
Striker : Well, I flew in the war, but that was years ago, I
wouldn't know anything about it.
Attndnt : Won't you go up, please? ( Striker agrees, passenger
next to him blows out match, but blows himself up
accidently anyway )
Striker : The stewardess said . . . BOTH PILOTS????????
Rumack : Can fly this plane?
Striker : Surely you can't be serious?
Rumack : I am serious, and don't call me Shirley!
Attndnt : Doctor, I've checked everyone. Mr. Striker is the
only one.
Rumack : What flying experience have you had?
Striker : I flew single engine fighters in the Air Force,
but this plane has four engines. Its an entirely
different kind of flying, altogether.
All Together: Its a entirely different kind of flying.
Striker : Besides, I haven't touched any kind of plane in six
years.
Rumack : Mr. Striker, I know nothing about flying, but there's
one thing I do know: You're the only one on this plane
who can possibly fly it, you're the only chance we've
got.
MCrosky : NO, that's right, that's what I said . . . tell them all
to acknowledge and stand-by. Get me every piece of
emergency equipment you can reach. Alert rescue units
every mile of the way, from here to the rockies.
Towergy : Chief . . .
MCrosky : We'll need a pre-landing flight check, tell 'em I want
it in the dispatch office and tell 'em I want it here
fast.
Towergy : Its your wife.
MCrosky : ( To wife ) I want the kids in bed by nine, the dog
fed, the yard watered and the gate locked. And get a
note to the milkman NO MORE CHEESE! CLICK! Where the
hell's Kramer?
Kramer : No, we can't do that, the risk of a flame out is too
great, leave 'em at 24,000 . . . no, feet. One of the
passengers is gonna land that plane.
Paul : Is that possible?
Kramer : Possible, its a 100-1 shot. ( Car hits a cyclist )
Kramer : I know this guy.
Paul : You do?
Cyclist : Asssss-hole!
Paul : Who is it?
Kramer : Name is Ted Striker, I flew with him during the war,
it won't make my job any easier tonight. Ted Striker
was a crack flight leader, up to a point. He was one
of those men who, lets say, felt to much inside, maybe
you know the kind. Went all to pieces on one particular
mission, lets just hope that doesn't happen tonight.
Striker : Lets see. Altitude, 24,000 feet... level flight, speed
520 knots. Course, 0-9er-0, trim, mixture, wash, rinse,
spin . . .
Elaine : Ted, what are you doing here? You can't fly this plane!
Striker : That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
Rumack : Elaine, I don't have time to say this gently so I'll be
very direct everyone on this plane is in a desperate
situation, Mr. Striker is the only hope we've got.
Striker : Those are the flaps, this is the thrust, this must turn
on the landing lights ( Plane starts to nose dive when
that knob is turned ) Mayday, mayday, mayday.
MCrosky : MAYDAY? What the hell does that mean?
Johnny : Mayday? Why that's the Russian New Year. You know,
we'll have a big parade, we'll serve hot hor'doevres . .
Oldlady : I can't stand it anymore, I've got to get outta here.
I've gotta get outta here.
Elaine : Calm down get ahold of yourself.
Gentlmn : Stewardess, please, let me handle this ( grabs her and
starts to shake her )
Gntlmn2 : Calm down, now get back to your seat, I'll take care of
this. CALM DOWN, GET AHOLD OF YOURSELF !
Nun : Mr, your wanted on the phone . . . Everything's going
to be alright ! Please.
Gntlmn3 : Sister, I'll handle this. 
( There is now a line of people with baseball bats and whips
waiting to help the woman )
Zealot5 : Excuse me, we'd like you to have this flower ( Kramer
punches the man )
Zealot6 : Excuse me sir, would you . . . ( Kramer pushes him out
of the way )
Zealot7 : Donations for the Reverend Moon? ( Kramer punches him )
Zealot8 : Jews for Jesus? ( Crack ! ) Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...
Zealot9 : Read about Jehovah's witness? ( Kramer kicks him )
Zealt10 : How about Buddhism? ( Whack! )
Zealt11 : Help Jerry's kids? ( punch! )
Zealt12 : Scientology?
Zealt13 : Avoid nuclear power? ( Bap ! Bop ! )
Announc : Your attention please! No Frills passengers no arriving
please have your baggage claim checks ready to show the
attendant upon leaving the terminal. ( Passengers are
coming down the conveyer belt for luggage )
Kramer : I know but this guy has no flying experience at'all.
He's a menace to himself and everything else in the
air. . . yes, birds too.
MCrosky : Okay, okay, he's a terrible risk, but what other choice
have we got? That's the whole story there Rex,
everything we know.
Kramer : Alright Steve, lets face a few facts. As you know I
flew with this man during the war. He's going to
have enough on his mind without worrying about those
times when . . . when things weren't so good.
MCrosky : Right now, things aren't so good.
Kramer : Let me tell you something Steve, Ted Striker was a
top notch squadron leader a long time ago.
MCrosky : I want you to get on the horn and talk that guy down
Now, you're going to have to let him get the feel of
that airplane, and you'll have to talk him on to the
approach. So help me, you'll have to talk him right
down to the ground. ( Crash )
Kramer : Very well, put Striker on the speaker.
MCrosky : Use my radio there. Looks like I picked the wrong week
to quit drinking. ( gulp )
Towergy : Now, you can work 'im direct from here, Captain.
Kramer : Thanks. Striker . . . Striker, this is Captain Rex
Kramer speaking.
Striker : YES, -CAPTAIN- Kramer, I read you loud and clear.
Kramer : Alright, its obvious you remember me. What do you
say you and I just forget about everything except
what we have to do now.
Striker : Lets not kid each other _Kramer_ you know I've never
flown a bucket like this. I'm gonna need all the
luck there is.
Kramer : Standby Striker. Our one hope is to build this man
up, I've got to give him all the confidence I can.
Striker- have you ever flown a multi-engine plane
before?
Striker : NO, never.
Kramer : ( TO McCrosky thinking that the radio to Striker is off)
SHIT! This is a God damned waste of time, there's no
way he can land that plane.
MCrosky : (Radio is still on) Grab ahold of yourself, you gotta
talk him down, you gotta.
Kramer : We ought to route him in Lake Michigan, at least we'll
avoid killing innocent people.
MCrosky : You're the only chance they've got.
Kramer : Alright, Striker, you listen and listen close flying a
plane is no different from riding a bicycle, just alot
harder to put baseball cards in the spokes. Now, first
I want you to get the feel of the plane. Later, we'll
run down the landing procedure. Now, I want you to
disengage the automatic pilot . . . watch that you don't
make any violent control movements like you did in the
fighter planes.
Striker : Alright, I'm going to unlock the automatic pilot.
Kramer : Now just remember the controls will feel very heavy
compared to a fighter. Don't worry about that its
perfectly normal. ( Plane starts to nosedive and
passengers begin to panic ) Now one more thing,
is there somebody there who can work the radio
and leave you free for flying?
Striker : Yes, the stewardess is here with me.
Kramer : Good, have her sit in the co-pilot's seat.
Striker : Elaine, he wants you to sit in the co-pilot's seat.
Passengr: What's going on? We have a right to know the truth!
Rumack : Alright, I'm going to level with you all. The most
important thing now is that you remain calm. There's
no reason to panic ( his nose starts to grow ). Now,
it is true that one of the crew members is ill,
slightly ill, but the other two pilots are just fine,
they're at the controls, flying the plane, free to
pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
Striker : The radio's all yours now. And keep an eye on that
number 3 engine gauge over there, its running a
little hot ( sign flashes "a little hot" )
Kramer : Striker, before we start, I'd like to say something.
I know that right now things must look pretty rough
up there, but if you do what I tell you, when I tell
you to do it, there's no reason why you shouldn't
have complete confidence in your chances to come out
of this thing alive and in one piece. Striker, what
kind of weather are you in up there?
Elaine : Rain!
Striker : And a little ice.
Elaine : And a little ice.
Kramer : How's it handling?
Striker : Sluggish, like a wet sponge.
Elaine : Sluggish, like a wet sponge.
Kramer : Alright, Striker, your doing just fine.
Striker : Its a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate
his guts.
Elaine : Its a damn good thing you don't know how much he
hates your guts.
Jivemn2 : Mnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Attndnt : Can I get you something?
Jivemn2 : S'mo fo butter layin' to the bone. Jackin' me up.
Tightly.
Attndnt : I'm sorry I don't understand.
Jivemn1 : Cutty say he cant hang.
Woman4 : Oh stewardess, I speak jive.
Attndnt : Ohhhh, good.
Woman4 : He said that he's in great pain and he wants to know
if you can help him.
Attndnt : Would you tell him to just relax and I'll be back as
soon as I can with some medicine.
Woman : Jus' hang loose blooood. She goonna catch up on the`
rebound a de medcide.
Jivemn2 : What it is big mamma, my mamma didn't raise no dummy, I
dug her rap.
Woman4 : Cut me som' slac' jak! Chump don wan no help, chump
don git no help. Jive ass dude don got no brains
anyhow.
MCrosky : Get me Captain Oever's wife on the phone, we'd better
let her know what's going on.
Towergy : Chief, this weather bulletin just came off the wire.
MCrosky : Johnny, what can you make outta this?
Johnny : This? Why I could make a hat, or a brooch, a
pterodactyl. . .
( Phone rings at Captain Oever's wife's house, she answers. )
MSOever : Hello?
Towergy : Mrs. Oever?
MSOever : Yes, this is Mrs. Oever.
Towergy : This is Ed Masias calling from the airport. There's
some trouble on your husband's flight. We don't know
how serious it is yet, but Steve McCrosky say you may
want to get down here right away.
MSOever : Yes, I'll be right down. . . ( hangs up the phone )
I've gotta go to the airport, you can let yourself
out the back door. There's juice in the refridger-
ator. ( We see she is sleeping with a horse)
Horse : Nayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.... plllllllllllllllllllll.
Winey.
Elaine : Dr Rumack says the sick people are getting worse and
we`re running out of time.
Striker : ( In echoey voice to himself ) I've got to concentrate
oncentrate, oncentrate. I've got to concentrate,
concentrate, concentrate. Hello, hello, hello.
Echo, echo, echo. Pinch hitting for Pedro Borbau
Manny Motta, motta, motta.
Man : How're you doing honey?
Woman5 : I'm so hot, I'm burning up.
Man : I'll turn on some air. ( The whole cabin starts to blow
with wind. " Close the window " )
Striker : Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic, when do
we start down?
Kramer : Not just yet, but you're in our range any second now.
I don't understand it should have been in range 10
minutes ago. Genderson, check the radar range,
anything yet?
Gendrsn : ( Looks in an oven ) Its about 2 more minutes chief.
MCrosky : 2 more minutes? They could be miles off course.
Kramer : That's impossible there on instruments ( a brass
ensemble begins to play )
MCrosky : This is going to be a real sweat. Genderson, let me
know when you get anything. Got a cigarette Nelson?
I can't take much more of this. Looks like I picked
the wrong week to quit amphetamines. Johnny, how
about some more coffee?
Johnny : NO THANKS!
Towergy : Chief, these reporters won't leave without a statement.
Reportr : How much longer can those passengers hold out?
MCrosky : A, half an hour or less.
Reportr : Who's flying the plane?
MCrosky : One of the passengers. But, he's an experienced Air
Force pilot who flew during the war, so there's no
cause for alarm. . . Here, take over.
Reportr : What kind of plane is it?
Johnny : Oh its a big pretty white plane with red stripes,
curtains in the window and wheels. It looks like
a big tylenol.
Reportr : Okay boys, lets get some pictures. ( Take photos off
of wall . . .)
( Various reports from around the world are shown )
TVGUY : This bulletin just handed to me . . . stricken airliner
approaches Chicago.
Countpt : They bought their tickets, they knew what they were
getting into. I say let em crash.
Man2 : Would you like a little whiskey ma'am?
Woman6 : ( In a berating voice ) CERTAINLY NOT! ( She the does
cocaine )
Striker : How are the passengers doing?
Rumack : I won't deceive you Mr. Striker . . . we're running out
of time.
Striker : Surely there must be something you can do.
Rumack : I'm doing everything I can and stop calling me Shirley.
Nun : R-E-S-P-E-C-T find out what it means to me . . . Sock
it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me . . . A little
respect ( passenger vomits as she sings ) Just a little
bit . . .
Attndnt : Booo-hooo ( she crys )
Rumack : Randy, are you alright?
Attndnt : Oh, Dr. Rumack, I'm scared. I've never been so scared.
And besides, I'm 26 and I'm not married.
Rumack : We're going to make it, you've got to believe that.
Woman3 : Dr. Rumack, do you have any idea when we'll be landing?
Rumack : Pretty soon, how are you bearing up?
Woman3 : Well, to be honest, I've never been so scared. But, at
least I have a husband. ( Randy sobs harder )
Voice : Stay in formation, target's just ahead. Target should
be clear if you go in low enough. You'll have to decide
You'll have to decide...
Striker : oh rats! we lost number 4.
Elaine : What happened Ted, what went wrong?
Striker : The oil pressure, I forgot to check the oil pressure.
When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit
the fan ( We see shit hitting a fan )
Kramer : Watch that oil temperature, what the hell's he doing up
there? Striker, that plane can't land itself, it
takes a pilot that can handle pressure.
MCrosky : Ease off Rex, he hasn't flown for years, its not his
fault. It could happen to any pilot.
Johnny : It happened to Barbara Stanwick.
MCrosky : Don't push him too hard, give him a break. You gotta
remember who you're dealing with.
Johnny : Nick, Leaf, Jerrod, there's a fire in the barn.
Striker : He's right, I can't take the pressure. I was crazy to
think I could land this plane.
Elaine : Ted, you're the only hope.
Striker : I don't care. ( Plane starts to nosedive again ) I don't
have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone
who'd never flown before.
MCrosky : Bad news, the fog is getting thicker.
Johnny : And Leon's getting laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrger.
Striker : I know what you're going to say, so save your breath.
Rumack : Well, I don't have anything to say, you've done the
best you could. You really have, the best you could.
You can't expect to win em all. But, I want to tell
you something I've kept to myself through these years.
I was in the war myself, medical corps. I was on late
duty one night when they brought in a badly wounded
pilot from one of the raids. He could barely talk.
He looked at me and said " The odds were against
us up there, but we went in anyway, I'm glad Captain
made the right decision. The pilot's name was George
Zip.
Striker : George Zip said that?
Rumack : The last thing he said to me, doc, he said, "Sometime
when the crew is up against it, the breaks are beating
the boys, tell them to get out there and give it all
they got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't
know where I'll be then doc, he said, but I won't smell
too good, that's for sure.
Striker : Excuse me doc, I got a plane to land.
Kramer : Alright Striker, you'd better stay up there for a bit,
as soon as the fog lifts, we'll bring you in.
Striker : I'll take it Elaine. Listen to me Kramer, Dr. Rumack
says the sick people are in critical condition. And
every minute counts. We've got to land now.
Kramer : Don't be a fool Striker, you know what a landing like
this means, you more than anybody. I'm ordering you
to stay up there.
Striker : NO DICE CHICAGO. I'm giving the orders and we're
coming in. I guess the foot's on the other hand now,
isn't it Kramer?
Kramer : He'll never make it in this soup, not one chance in a
million.
MCrosky : I know, I know, but its his ship now, his command, he's
in charge, he's the boss, head man, top dog, big cheese,
Towergy : Captain, look at this!
MCrosky : Passengers certain to die!
Kramer : Airline negligent.
Johnny : There's a sale at Penny's!
MCrosky : Alright, I'll need 3 men up in the tower. You Newbower,
you Maceias. . .
Johnny : Me John! Big tree.
Kramer : Standby, Striker. We're going to the tower, good luck.
Johnny : The tower, the tower . . . Repunzle, Repunzle . . .
Woman4 : Stewardess, how soon so we land?
Attndnt : It won't be long now, try not to worry.
Towerguy: We're all ready sir, this is Captain McCrosky, Captain
Roberts, Captain Kramer, Captain Kolosomo, Captain
Henshaw this is Captain Gatz, Captain Kramer, Captain
Gatz, Captain Henshaw, Captain Roberts.
MCrosky : Alright Kolosomo, you work the relay, Roberts, check all
air traffic within five miles, get that finger out of
your ear, you don't know where that finger's been ( guy
smells his finger ) Got a cigarette Nels? Your husband
and the others are alive, but unconscious.
Johnny : Just like Gerald Ford.
MCrosky : Now, there's a chance we can save them, if Striker can
get that plane down in time.
MSOever : That isn't much of a chance, is it?
MCrosky : I don't know, I don't know, but we're doing everything
we can, now excuse me huh?
Johnny : Where did you get that dress? Its aweful . . . and
those shoes, and that coat, geeeeeeeeeeeeeezzzzzzzz.
( Tower Guys Playing Atari basketball on radar screen )
Towergy : 8 miles. Looks like their heading 0-4-4.
Elaine : We are now at 2000 feet beginning our decent.
Kramer : Steve, I want every light you can get poured onto
that field. ( A dump truck dumps table lamps onto the
runway )
Towergy : Tower to all emergency vehicles, runway is 9er.
Airport vehicles take stations 1 and 2. Civilian
equipment number 3. Air Force positions number 4
and 5. All ambulances go to number 3. Air
Israel, please clear the runway ( Plane is shown
wearing a beard, hat, tallis, and yarmulke. )
Attendnt: In a moment, we'll ask you to assume crash positions.
your life jackets are located under your seat. Place
the jacket over your head. And when I give the word,
pull the cord on the right side flap. Your seat
cushions are also equipped with a flotation device.
Radio : WZAZ in Chicago, where disco lives forever ( plane
knocks down station's transmitter )
Kramer : Watch your altitude Striker, you're too erratic. You
can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left
for two hours of flying.
Striker : I'll take it Elaine. Listen to me Kramer! We have
people up here who will die in less than an hour
let alone two. I may bend your precious airplane,
but I'll get it down. I'm putting the landing gear
down now.
Attendnt: Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
Striker : Thank you Randy. You'd better leave sweetheart. You
might get hurt up here.
Elaine : Ted,
Striker : Yes?
Elaine : I wanted you to know, now . . . I'm very proud.
Striker : Tell 'em the gear is down and we're ready to land.
Elaine : The gear is down and we're ready to land.
Kramer : Alright, he's on final now, put out all runway lights
except 9er.
Towerguy: Captain, maybe we ought to turn on the search lights
now.
MCrosky : No, thats just what they'll be expecting us to do.
Rumack : I just want to tell you both good luck, we're all
counting on you.
Kramer : Alright, now just listen carefully . . . you should
be able to see the runway at 300 feet. Aim the
touchdown a third of the way along. There's a slight
crosswind from the right so be ready for it. Land
too fast, use your emergency breaks. The red handle's
right in front of you. If that doesn't stop you . . .
( long pause ) . . . if that doesn't stop you cut the
four ignition switches over the co-pilot's head.
Do you see us now? You should be able to see the field
now. ( Dog barks )
MCrosky : It sure is quiet out there. . .
Kramer : Yeah, too quiet.
MCrosky : Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing
glue. ( inhales some glue and falls over )
Striker : There it is.
Kramer : There he is. Striker, you're coming in too fast . . .
Striker : I know, I know.
Elaine : He knows, he knows.
Airdude : Getting below 700 now, still going down. 675, 650, 625,
he's holding. . .no, no he's down, he's down.
Kramer : Sound your alarm bell, now.
Attendnt: Alright now everybody, get in crash positions ( The
passengers arrange themselves as if they just crash-
ed. )
Kramer : Put down 30 degrees of flap. Striker now listen to me
Remember your breaks and switches, get ready to fly it
out . . .
Airdude : He's all over the place, 900 feet, up to 1300 feet . . .
what an asshole.
Kramer : More mast rudder, put down more flap . . .
Johnny : ( Unplugs runway lights ) Just kidding.
Kramer : Striker, lift your nose, straighten your wings. You're
coming in too fast, watch your speed.
MCrosky : He's coming right at us . . . ( jumps through a window )
Kramer : You're coming in too hot. Ease up on the throttle.
Watch for that crosswind. Aim for the numbers, you'll
have to dip your left wing. You're drifting, keep your
eyes on the far end of the runway. You're too low
damnit! Watch your stall speed. Ease her down, down.
The break . . . pull the red handle.
Rumack : I just want to tell you both good luck, we're all
counting on you.
Voice2 : Flight 2-0-9 now arriving gate 8- gate 9, gate 10
Kramer : Push a button.
Voice2 : Gate 13, gate 14, gate 15 . . .
Johnny : Auntie Em, Uncle Henry, toto . . . its a twister,
its a twister.
Voice : Gate 23, 24, 25 . . .
( Plane lands safely )
Rumack : I just want to tell you both-- good luck, we're all
counting on you.
Kramer : Striker, Striker, you alright?
Striker : Yeah, we're okay.
Kramer : Ted that was probably the worst landing in the history
of this airport, but some of us here, particularly me
would like to buy you a drink and shake your hand . .
and Ted I just want you to know that when the going
got rough . . .
Attendnt: Okay alright, have a nice day . . .have a nice day,
thank you for flying TransAmerican.
Kramer : Lonliness, thats the bottom line. I was never happy
as a child . . . Christmas Ted, what does that mean
to you? It was living hell. Do you know what its
like falling in the mud and getting kicked, in the head.
With an iron boot? Of course you don't, no one does,
that never happens. Sorry Ted, that's a dumb question.
Attendnt: Have a nice day.
Kramer : Municipal bonds Ted, I'm talking double A rating. . .
the best investment in America.
(Ted and Elaine go off into the sunset
and Otto and his inflatable friend Ottoette fly the plane off)








Let's go!
Move it!

  
50 more yards!

  
All right, let's go! Pick it up!

  
- Let's go!
- Yes, sir!

  
You're running out of time, Bryant!

  
Make it all the way around the track!
Come on!

  
You want to be troopers?
You better move it!

  
All right, next, get up here!

  
Let's hit it now.

  
Dean, come on!

  
All right.
You've all completed the written exam.

  
However, you must now pass
the obstacle course

  
to be admitted into the training program.

  
And remember, survive this,

  
and you're on the front lines
of keeping New Jersey safe.

  
Yeah.

  
Sorry about the test, Dad.

  
We all have our crosses to bear, sweetheart.

  
Mine is named hypoglycemia.

  
Well, that's why you always have to have
sugar nearby.

  
Are you gonna have pie?

  
Not tonight, Ma.

  
I'm just kidding.
Yeah, I'm gonna want some pie.

  
You...

  
No, I meant now, Ma. Get the pie now.

  
- Okay.
- You said it,

  
and I just kind of got that
stuck in my head now,

  
and can't really get it out. Pie. Here we go.

  
It really helps heal.

  
And, you know, not always, but sometimes,

  
you gotta do like the kids say,
and just say, "Whatever."

  
Kids don't talk like that.

  
Some do, sweetheart. The older ones, okay?

  
I hear them in the mall. You know?

  
Peanut butter.

  
It just fills the cracks of the heart.

  
Go away, pain.

  
- What?
- Paulie.

  
Oh, no. Come on, Ma.

  
I'm not ready for this right now.

  
- Dad.
- Please.

  
We just don't want to see you go through
another holiday alone.

  
But I'm not alone.

  
I've got you two. You know?

  
And besides, Black Friday's coming,

  
so my dance card's gonna be pretty full.

  
What?
It's the busiest shopping day of the year.

  
Yeah, I should have known better
than to try to explain it to civilians.

  
I wish I had a coworker here, like, "Tyler,
hey. You know, Black Friday's coming."

  
"Gee, Paul, you don't have to tell me
Black Friday's coming.

  
"Why do you think
I've been walking around here

  
"with the eyes of an eagle?"

  
- We prepare.
- Dad, what does all that have to do

  
with being happy for the rest of your life?

  
You said, and I quote,
"If I don't have a girlfriend by November,

  
"I'll let you sign me up
for perfectmatch.com."

  
That was last year.

  
Okay.

  
- Here we are.
- Okay.

  
"What are you looking for in a woman?"

  
Well, your mother certainly
had something special.

  
Yeah, illegal immigrant status.

  
She married you, got citizenship,
and then she left us.

  
That's not entirely true.

  
We did have some good times
back when she was still trying to trick me.

  
- Well, I hate her.
- Well, you shouldn't.

  
She gave me you.

  
- I am pretty great.
- You are. You are.

  
Okay, next question.
"Tell us about yourself."

  
Let's see.

  
I know a lot about sharks.

  
Let me stop you right there.

  
Well-built and a great hugger.

  
Awesome, Grandma.

  
Not as awesome as this.

  
What are you doing?

  
Beefing up your profile with that
nifty video that you made a few years back.

  
Ma, no.

  
I don't know. Don't you think
it's a little too, "Hey, look at me"?

  
Well, that is exactly what we want.

  
Eyes on the prize.

  
And don't worry,
I will edit out the sweaty parts.

  
Dear God!

  
Hey! Back away from the vehicle.

  
Oh, dear God. Please.

  
Chompers, get down!

  
Hey, you know where a men's room is?

  
I do.
You're gonna want to go to Lord and Taylor.

  
They got 12 stalls and heated seats.

  
Okay, keep the balls in the pit, kids. Kids!

  
Okay, my lip is numb.

  
All righty.

  
- There you go.
- Thank you.

  
Hey.

  
Yeah, I know.

  
That's not supposed to be here.
It's a minivan.

  
... he can't handle it.
The puck travels to the far board...

  
He keeps the play alive.

  
- Paul!
- Hey.

  
What is this?

  
That's my report on how to ease
traffic flow from Macy's

  
down through the specialty shops.

  
- How's that working out for you?
- Actually, it's for all of us.

  
You see, if we could reroute the customers
away from the food court,

  
it's gonna help the kiosks
and cut down on shopper frustration.

  
It's your classic two-bird,
one-stone scenario.

  
- Can I ask you something?
- Anything.

  
Why can't you just punch in, shut up
and punch out like the rest of us?

  
Safety never takes a holiday.

  
Did your mom crochet that on a pillow?

  
Blart.

  
This is Sims. He's a new trainee.
Let him trail you today.

  
Hey. Paul Blart. Ten-year veteran.

  
Wow. Veck Sims.

  
Well, Veck Sims, welcome to the show.
Let's mount up.

  
Oh, yeah. That's the good stuff.

  
That's it. Treat her gentle, son.

  
Slap it, honor it.

  
So what made you want to pursue security?

  
I never finished high school.
This is all I could get.

  
Yeah, I'm currently working on becoming
a state trooper, myself.

  
Right now, I'm goose egg for eight.
Hypoglycemia.

  
Confusing, right? Cut yourself some slack.

  
My first week riding on the job,
I got lost behind the Sears.

  
They found me later in the fetal position,
sporting a full beard.

  
I'm kidding. I can't grow a beard.

  
My uncle can. Stay snug.

  
Now, in the event
that you approach an assailant,

  
here's what I want you to do.
You're gonna pull up,

  
left hip forward, placing your right hand
on your away hip thusly,

  
giving the illusion that you have a gun.
Which, of course, we both know

  
you don't.

  
Okay? But you know what we do have?

  
Our voices! We have our voices.

  
If you remember one thing
from today, it's this.

  
The mind is the only weapon
that doesn't need a holster.

  
Right. Awesome.
How long do we get for lunch?

  
Half hour. But I eat in 20, which leaves me
five minutes for social time,

  
five minutes to get refocused.

  
We got a high roller.

  
Sir, I'm gonna need you to pull to the right.

  
Please pull to the side, sir. Out of traffic.

  
Tan jacket, red scooter,
please pull to the right, out of traffic.

  
Sir.

  
Thank you.

  
Driving kind of recklessly back there, sir.

  
You're kidding.

  
I don't joke about shopper safety.

  
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
issue you a citation.

  
Gonna need your first and last. Last first.

  
Sir. Sir. Sir, sir, sir.

  
Please don't make this more difficult
than it needs to be, okay?

  
Are you able to...
Sir. Sir! Sir. I am warning you, sir.

  
You're pushing it.

  
Sir. Sir. I am warning... Sir.

  
Sir. Sir. Sir.

  
Okay.

  
This is adding up, sir. He'll be back.
He'll be back. He'll be back.

  
- Hey.
- Hi. Do you need something?

  
Yes. I'd like to welcome you to our mall.

  
Well, thank you.

  
Is there something else?

  
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

  
Just looking for some hair extensions.

  
Need a little more volume up top.
Do you do men?

  
Do you do men hair? Do you do men hair?
On the men?

  
Are you the guy
that crashed into the minivan?

  
I don't think so. Which one?

  
Well, that one. That one right there.

  
Yeah. That one, yes. That...
You know, that one was me.

  
- Oh, wow. Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah. Never better.

  
Although they're docking the paycheck
pretty good.

  
Yeah.

  
You know what you should do?
You should get the security tape,

  
and then, like, sell it to one of those shows,
you know, where people crash into stuff.

  
- Hello, early retirement.
- Yeah, right?

  
Volume. Right, let me just see what I've got.

  
Yeah, this is Blart.
If you need me, I'm over by the kiosks.

  
Who is this?

  
It's Officer Blart, reporting from Sector 5.

  
What the hell are you bothering me for?

  
- Just a Code B check.
- What a moron.

  
You know, I'll check in with them later.
It's pretty intense.

  
Oh, right, yeah. Life of a security guard.

  
- What, what?
- No, it's just that you said security guard,

  
and it's perfectly acceptable...

  
I'm so sorry if I called you the wrong thing.

  
No, no, no, no. You did fine, you know?

  
It's just that there's a huge,
huge controversy

  
brewing in the industry right now,

  
whether the title should be
Security Guard or Officer.

  
I'm sure you heard about it.

  
- I didn't.
- You will. You're gonna.

  
- But I'm sure I will.
- It's out there.

  
So, you all set
for the busiest shopping day of the year?

  
Yeah, right.
And the worst day for a birthday.

  
This year, it falls on a Black Friday, which
means I probably won't even get a card.

  
Everyone's too busy shopping.

  
You know what? Yeah. Autumn Ash.

  
- Yeah.
- I think that's your color.

  
- I think this'll work.
- It's a winner.

  
- So that's $9.95.
- $9.95?

  
- Yeah.
- Wow.

  
At those prices,
now you got me thinking ponytail.

  
All right. Thank you.

  
Thank you.

  
- Right. So there you go.
- Okay.

  
And, there you go.

  
Thank you, Amy.

  
Thank you, Officer Blart.

  
Hey, Blart. Wow, nice shirt.

  
You went with a medium?

  
It's a bit formfitting,

  
but that's 'cause we're required to wear
protective vests under our...

  
No. Not buying it. No.

  
'Cause I don't see any vest
underneath here, so...

  
No, but it's a thick T-shirt.
Basically like a thermal they have you wear.

  
Nope. Nope. No.

  
I don't understand why you're laughing.
I just called you fat.

  
I'm not laughing.

  
Yeah, whatever. Amy.

  
Hey, everyone's going to American Joe's
tonight, and I want to see you there.

  
Okay?
We're gonna split some onion strings.

  
Wow. Wow.

  
Good.

  
Good hang.

  
Wow, yeah. That's great.

  
Hey, Blart, they need you
at Victoria's Secret.

  
Okay, roger that.

  
Okay, I gotta go.

  
Okay. Bye.

  
- I found it first.
- No, you didn't.

  
Ladies. Problem.

  
What's the genesis?

  
She's trying to take
the last push-up bra in this size.

  
There's gonna be a new shipment tomorrow.
They'll be here by noon.

  
Well, I need this one now.
I have a date tonight.

  
Really? Is he blind?

  
Whoa!
Waterproof shoes and Baggies on the socks.

  
Not my first rodeo.

  
Okay, ladies, need to see some ID.

  
No, you don't.

  
Ma'am, I should warn you, I do have
the authority to make a citizen's arrest.

  
So does anyone.
I could arrest you right now.

  
- That's true. She could.
- Hey, not talking to you. Okay?

  
Can I see you for a second, please, ma'am?

  
Look, I understand your sensitivity.

  
I've had some issues with weight myself.

  
- Are you calling me fat?
- No. No, no, no, no.

  
I'm just saying I've been down that road.

  
I mean... I mean, I'm still on it.
We both are, you know? Stranded.

  
Let's face it, we eat to fill a void, right?

  
But as soon as I started eating healthier,

  
I noticed I wasn't so moody.

  
And PS, your skin's gonna clear up.

  
- Can you hold onto these?
- Sure.

  
Ma'am.

  
You...

  
She's got tremendous upper body strength.

  
Backup! Backup!

  
She's biting my neck. She's biting my neck.

  
Backup!

  
Backup! Backup!

  
Look, I know you're new here and all,

  
but "backup" seems like
a pretty universal term.

  
Hey. Can I give you a lift?

  
What, on that?

  
With an inexperienced driver
I would recommend no,

  
but with me,
you'll be as safe as the President.

  
I don't know. Couldn't that get you fired?

  
Yes, it could.

  
Okay.

  
- Is this all right?
- Absolutely.

  
And here you go. Safe and sound.

  
- '65 Mustang.
- Yeah.

  
Fun fact for you, a lot of people think
the Mustang was named after the horse.

  
It was actually named after
the P-51 Mustang.

  
- That's a plane.
- I didn't know that.

  
Well, thank you for the ride, Paul.
That was so much fun.

  
No problem.

  
Listen,

  
if you ever, you know, need rides anywhere,

  
Dispatch, they can get me. You know.

  
- Or we could just text each other.
- Yeah.

  
- Yeah, give me your cell phone.
- My cell?

  
Yeah, and I'll punch my number in.

  
Left it in the casuals. You know what?

  
Just give me your number
and I'll remember it.

  
- Okay. Ready?
- Yep.

  
- All right. 555...
- Not yet. Just...

  
Now I'm ready.

  
- 555...
- 555...

  
...01...
...01...

  
...78.
- Eight. Got it.

  
That's it. It's locked.

  
Great, so I'll see you tonight
at American Joe's, right?

  
Yeah, I mean, everybody's going, so...

  
- Yeah.
...why not me, too? I'll be...

  
Yeah, I'm there.

  
- Great. Bye.
- Okay. Bye.

  
- Hey.
- Hey! Hey. Glad you made it, Paul.

  
Good to be here.

  
- Fun fact for you...
- This place sucks.

  
- You want to get out of here?
- No.

  
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

  
No, I was just saying that

  
the first American Joe's actually opened
its doors in 1972.

  
And most people,
because of its service and theme,

  
think that it's derivative of Abe and Louie's,
but it's not.

  
It's its own thing.

  
You really know a lot of facts, Paul.

  
Hey, Blart, I heard you got your ass handed
to you by a fat chick at Victoria's Secret.

  
Well, I don't hit women,

  
- so I don't even know what...
- Yeah. Just minivans, right?

  
Hey, why don't you go over to the bar
and grab yourself one of those girly drinks?

  
- I'll meet you over there.
- Okay. Does anybody else want a drink?

  
- 'Cause Stuart's buying.
- No, no, no. They're good. They're good.

  
- So... They're good.
- Okay.

  
Hey, listen, I...
We're basically already together, so...

  
I wasn't... I didn't even realize that.

  
- And I was... I wouldn't... Doing anything.
- Yeah.

  
I just want you to grab a hold of it, tight.

  
- Okay?
- I got it.

  
I mean,
it's not like you really had a chance, okay?

  
Security guard? Really.

  
But you're a pen salesman, dude.

  
Yeah, and I just bought a Camry,
so you can eat me.

  
All right, bro. Back off.
You know, we're all just here having fun.

  
Okay, bro.

  
What?

  
Hey, thanks
for getting my back there, brother.

  
Security blood runs deep between...
Yeah, let's just go.

  
- Round six.
- Let's do this thing.

  
- Gentlemen ready?
- No.

  
Not yet. Now I'm ready. Okay.

  
And, go!

  
Leon, I can't give you the Heimlich,
so you better chew.

  
I know.

  
Told you, boy. You better hurry up.

  
There you go. Nachos in my face.

  
Oh, my God. These peppers.
The peppers are hot.

  
Oh, my God. Oh, that's a hot pepper.

  
Nachos are good, man.

  
Better inform all your friends, boy.
Nachos about to be gone.

  
You're lagging behind.

  
Come on, Paul. Playing games.

  
I love these nachos, I'll tell you that much.

  
- That lemonade is insane.
- Yeah, Paul.

  
- That's because it's a margarita.
- No. I don't drink.

  
Twist it.

  
Feel the nub.

  
- Hey, you want some? Here.
- Yeah.

  
You want fruit?

  
Bye! You blinked! You blinked.

  
Time to pluck the grape from the vine.

  
Still got the Baggies! Hot jiggity.

  
Coming on the left.

  
False alarm.

  
Told my mom everything about us.

  
What are you talking about?

  
You're acting coy. Come on. It's natural.

  
You know. You so know.

  
No, I'm sorry, Paul. I don't know.

  
Snap. Pop goes the weasel.

  
So happy!

  
Yeah!

  
Yeah!

  
I believe in magic!

  
No way!

  
I'm sorry it didn't work out, dear.

  
It's fine, Ma.

  
- Hey, Dad, why don't we check for matches?
- Yes.

  
Yeah, I don't think so, sweetheart.
I think I'm just gonna turn in.

  
Well, how about something special
for lunch tomorrow to cheer you up?

  
I don't think so, Ma. It's fine.

  
If something's gonna work,
it would be the sloppy joe.

  
But that would probably... You know.

  
You know, if you're doing the sloppy joe,
do the sweet potato fries.

  
But it... Whatever, you know.
Well done. Yeah.

  
Maya. Hey.

  
Dad. I'm so sorry.

  
It's okay.

  
There are other fish in the sea.

  
You just gotta keep looking.

  
And it doesn't matter what you do.

  
Because once someone takes the time
to get to know the real you,

  
all bets are off.

  
If it doesn't work out, you'll always have us.

  
I'm sorry, sweetie, I popped my ears.
I didn't hear a word you were saying.

  
You just have to...

  
Is that a tattoo?

  
I... Yeah, yeah, it is.

  
When did you get it?

  
- I got it last night.
- What is it?

  
It's the Loch Ness monster.

  
I don't drink.

  
- Hey.
- Hi.

  
That was

  
a little weird the other night, huh?

  
Yeah, you know, it had its moments. Yeah.

  
Was one of them
when I tried to make out with your purse?

  
You see, alcohol instantly turns to sugar
in the blood.

  
And what happens is the capillaries...

  
Yeah, look. A lot of people...

  
Pretty much everybody, you know, tends
to write me off.

  
And if you did, too, believe me, I get it.

  
I just...
I guess what I'm asking is that you don't.

  
Okay. You know, I'm sorry, I've just...

  
I've gotta cash my paycheck
before the bank closes. I'm...

  
No problem.
Maybe we could talk later or something?

  
- Yeah, sure. You could just text me, or...
- Okay.

  
- Yeah.
- I can do that. I can do that.

  
You know, Paul, everybody texts these days.

  
I can't believe you don't have a cell phone.

  
I'm not about all this technology, Vijay.

  
I prefer face-to-face interaction
or a nice handwritten sentiment.

  
300 bucks?

  
I dug myself into a really deep hole
with this girl, you gotta help me. Please.

  
Paul, you've always been a straight shooter,
so I'll tell you what.

  
Why don't you take my daughter
Parisa's phone?

  
- No, I can't do that.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

  
I'm punishing her.

  
No. What with all the parties
and that ex-boyfriend Pahud,

  
she went over her minutes.

  
When and if she decides to turn
her life around, I'll simply take it back.

  
Until then, you use it.

  
- Thanks.
- Sure.

  
- Stay within the minutes.
- Of course.

  
Hey. It's too late to go in that way, guys.
It's closed.

  
- No one's going in there.
- Yeah. I think we are.

  
Hey, yo, Paul. Come here, man.

  
Look, I know you been feeling down,
so I got this for you.

  
"The Devil's Crotch."

  
Feel the burn, baby.

  
- Thanks, Leon.
- Get back at me, man.

  
- Loading dock's ready.
- Got it.

  
Yeah.

  
You need a pen, don't you?

  
You know what? No, I'm good.

  
- I'll just use one of their pens.
- Yeah, you do.

  
Yes. The Summit 5280 fountain.

  
- That's stunning.
- Yeah, I know.

  
How would you like to sign your name
with this panther?

  
You know what? More than anything.

  
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Here. Yeah.

  
It's yours. I insist.

  
Oh, hey, guys.

  
- Hey.
- Hey.

  
- Hey.
- Don't you just love Fridays?

  
- Yeah.
- Best night of the week.

  
Yeah.

  
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- Hey.

  
Paul. Paul, can you help me out?

  
I need to shoot over to the bank
for a minute.

  
There's a few kids inside,
just finishing up their games.

  
Could you close up the arcade for me?

  
- Yeah, sure. No problem, Mr. Ferguson.
- Okay.

  
- You okay? You seem a little down.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

  
You know, video game might
cheer you right up.

  
Nah, I'm on duty.

  
Welcome to the games!

  
Get set.

  
Go.

  
Foul. Foul.

  
Foul. Foul.

  
Foul. Foul.

  
Foul. Foul. Foul. Foul.

  
Game over.

  
We are ready.

  
Let's do this.

  
Attention shoppers.

  
Please make your way to the nearest exits.

  
Unfortunately, the mall will be closing early.

  
- Everybody out!
- Everybody out!

  
Everybody out, now!

  
You, too!

  
Hi. Hey! Hey! You got me...

  
I'm at the West Orange Pavilion Mall.

  
Hey, yo. Hey, there's some crazy-ass people
trying to take over the mall.

  
- I'm out of here.
- Everybody on the floor!

  
Tell them to bring SWAT.
There may be hostages.

  
What are you doing? Get down.

  
Oh, my God.

  
Surprised? I know.

  
But here's the craziest part.

  
I'm the leader.

  
Reports are, they're inside the bank
and they got hostages.

  
This is Sergeant Howard. I need four units
around the back to secure the perimeter.

  
See if we can establish visual.
Report back to me immediately.

  
Let's get all these civilians out of here.

  
See if we can gain access
into the loading dock.

  
- Go.
- I'm on it. 94, move 'em out.

  
Hello?

  
Feeling alive?

  
I'm sorry?

  
Parisa.

  
She makes you feel alive, doesn't she?

  
This must be Pahud.
Pahud, no, I'm not with Parisa.

  
My name's Paul Blart.

  
Parisa's dad took her cell phone away,
and he lent it to me.

  
Do not lie to me, Paul Blart.
Do not lie to me.

  
You are probably
sweating over her right now.

  
I'm not lying.

  
I mean, I am sweaty,
but I'm not sweating over anyone.

  
That woman is like an angelic goddess
who only brings goodness to this world.

  
Plus, she has some crazy sexy feet.

  
Paul, the pain of this breakup
is far too much for me to bear, man.

  
Pahud, no one can blame you
for being upset.

  
I mean, the holidays are tough enough
without adding heartbreak to the mix.

  
Wow. Them's some heavy words, Paul Blart.

  
Hey, life is heavy.

  
Indeed. Now, you are at the mall, huh?

  
So why do you not head over
to Orange Julius,

  
call up my friend Sameer Oh?

  
Tell him you are now my homeboy.
He will hook you up.

  
Wait a second.
How'd you know I was at the mall?

  
I track Parisa's phone with GPS.
Don't you judge me.

  
Closing time already.

  
Okay, there are 223 stores in this mall.

  
Here is a list of the 15 that I need you to hit.

  
And 15 for you.

  
Okay.

  
Now this is the key to retrieve the codes
from each store's credit-card machine.

  
They change every day, so make sure

  
that you bring me back the codes
for today, Friday.

  
Veck, six guys in standard formation,
just like you said.

  
Perfect.

  
Bomb! Bomb! Bomb! Bomb!

  
And these little piggies went
all the way home.

  
Do it.

  
Gary usually delivers the leftovers
to the Mission.

  
Hey, everyone. A couple requests.

  
Kindly tie up the person beside you,
keep your mouths shut,

  
give up your cell phones,
and as a general rule, do as I say.

  
You do all these things...
Well, you'll be back at home in no time.

  
Back to your mediocre lives.

  
- I don't have one.
- Amy.

  
I was hoping that you and I could have
a whole Bonnie-and-Clyde thing going on.

  
You know, minus dying
in a hail of gunfire, of course.

  
What do you say?

  
Go to hell.

  
Ouch.

  
Hey, Stewie, you don't mind
that I'm hitting on your girlfriend, do you?

  
What? No. She's not my girlfriend.

  
But I specifically heard you say
that you two were "basically together."

  
No. I didn't say that we were together.
I said that she's into leather.

  
Have at it. If you...

  
God, you're an idiot.

  
Hello?

  
This is Sergeant Howard
of the West Orange Police Department.

  
- Who am I speaking with?
- Hi.

  
Yeah, well, so here's the deal.

  
As you learned the hard way,
I have motion sensors by all the doors,

  
so if you wanna enter my mall,

  
you might as well bring
at least six body bags.

  
He's drilling the safe,
and they have eyes on us.

  
See if we can tap into the security cameras.

  
Now look, no one's gonna try
and enter the mall.

  
Is there anything you need? Do you need
any food? Do you need any water?

  
Oh, man. This dude
doesn't deviate from the book at all.

  
You know, since you're asking,
I would love a Happy Meal,

  
you know, but...
Make sure the toy is the sea monster,

  
'cause I already have the dragon.

  
Okay, okay, now what is it you really want?

  
Silence.

  
Hey, I'm sorry, mall's closed,

  
but I can help you find the nearest exit
if you just tell me where you parked.

  
Sweet mercy.

  
This is not happening,
this is not happening, this is...

  
Oh, God. All right, think, Paul, think.

  
Now what are you trained to do?

  
Nothing.

  
Detect, deter, observe, report.
I gotta report it. Reporting it.

  
Yo, we got a straggler.

  
- It's a security guard.
- What should we do?

  
I don't know. Give up, I guess.

  
Guys, what is wrong with you?
We stick to the plan.

  
We got a 911 operator connecting us
with some guy named Paul Barth.

  
He says he's a security officer in the mall.

  
Hey. Blart? He's one of my guys.

  
Paul, this is Sergeant Howard
of West Orange Police Department.

  
The mall has been taken over,
and they have hostages.

  
I need you to exit the building immediately.

  
We don't need any wild cards
in this situation.

  
Copy that. Never been a wild card.

  
Unless you consider the game of Uno wild.

  
- Blart! Can we focus here, please?
- Yes. Yes, sir. On my way out.

  
Okay, okay. Come on, don't die. Don't die.

  
Blart.

  
Don't pee. Don't pee.

  
Guys, motion detector just went off
at Door 26. Everybody on it.

  
Amy.

  
What the hell is he doing? Come on!

  
- Paul, come on!
- Paulie, come on!

  
- What's he doing?
- Come on, Blart!

  
Blart, come on!

  
- Let's go! Move it!
- Come on! Come on!

  
- Get out of there!
- Come on!

  
Is he crying?

  
- I can't leave her.
- Where's he going?

  
- Blart!
- Where's he going?

  
Blart, get back! Will you talk to him, please?

  
Blart, this is Brooks. What's going on?

  
Sir, I took a sworn oath to protect this mall
and all inside it.

  
What oath? We don't have an oath.

  
I sort of made up my own.
It's on a plaque in my room.

  
Listen, I think you're making a big mistake.

  
SWAT's on the way.

  
And I'm not gonna sugarcoat it,
you're untrained, you're unarmed,

  
and let's face it, son,
you present a huge target.

  
With all due respect, sir,
I can't observe and report from the outside.

  
Over.

  
Well, Sergeant,
looks like you got your eyes on the inside.

  
Amy, Paul Blart here.
Are you still in the mall?

  
Send.

  
Got him.

  
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

  
Think. Think. Think, think, think,
think, think, think, think! Think!

  
Hold it together.

  
Heart of a warrior.

  
I missed lunch.

  
Thank you.

  
This isn't happening, this is not happening.

  
Hey! Don't make this hard.

  
You like that?

  
Brooks, I took out a girl,
but the guy, he ran away.

  
- Wow, Paul, you got one.
- Yes.

  
But let the record show,
I did not hit a woman. I just...

  
I put all my weight on her.

  
Oh, Paul.

  
No, no, no. She's fine, she's fine.

  
Well, good, let's get you out of there.

  
No can do, sir.
I am gonna finish what I started.

  
What the heck is this?

  
Give me that.

  
Paul, this is Sergeant Howard again.

  
Since you refuse to come out,
I'm gonna need you to go into the bank

  
and find out
where they're holding the hostages.

  
With honor, sir.

  
Good to know.

  
Hey, I haven't heard back
from Donner or Vixen.

  
Okay. I'm calling an audible here, everyone.

  
And I need to get this mall locked down
from the inside immediately.

  
Why don't we just start wasting hostages?
That'll stop them.

  
Well, that's one way to go, but our hostages
are the only thing keeping the cops outside.

  
I'm Commander Kent. My team is deploying.
I need this location secured.

  
- We got a three-block perimeter...
- Establish a perimeter

  
and get all these people out of here.

  
Whoa, whoa, this is all done already.

  
My men are gonna do it again, the right way.

  
Have your guys fall back, now.
Have there been any demands?

  
- A Happy Meal and absolute silence.
- Well, let's make some noise.

  
I got snipers at the ready,
communications in check.

  
Let's tap into security now,
and let's get some visuals.

  
You can't.
They knocked out the video cameras.

  
I'll be ready to take on-scene command
in three, two, one. I'm in charge.

  
Brooks, I'm observing the bank now.

  
They got one assailant
guarding the hostages.

  
There she is.

  
My, God. You are my angel pie.

  
Here come the love sweats.

  
Paul, your radio's still on.

  
Roger that.

  
- What's going on? Who is that?
- We got a guy on the inside.

  
Don't tell me one of your beat cops
is trying to be a hero.

  
No, he's neither. His name is Blart.
He's one of my security guards.

  
- Wait a minute. Blart?
- Yeah.

  
- Paul Blart?
- Yeah.

  
Are you kidding me? We used to abuse
that loser in high school. Give me that.

  
Blart.

  
This is Commander James Kent.
New Jersey SWAT.

  
We went to high school together.
Remember?

  
I set you on fire at the pancake festival?

  
Oh, yeah. Hey, Jimmy.

  
Go Green Hawks.

  
Yeah, listen. I've got 50 highly trained,
armed professionals out here.

  
At my command,
we are retaking this location,

  
and there's no way I'm compromising
this mission so that some mall monitor

  
who used to eat lunch
with his imaginary friend can screw it up.

  
Sorry, Jimmy, I had the button pressed.
All I heard was "lunch" and "friend."

  
Could you do me a favor
and put Chief Brooks back on?

  
Listen to me, Blart,

  
you are no longer communicating
with Chief Brooks. Is that clear?

  
Hello?

  
Hello?

  
Yeah? Oh, hey, Paul, how you doing?

  
Well, it looks like they moved the hostages
into the teller area.

  
I'm gonna get a closer look.

  
Veck.

  
There he is!

  
- Everyone in the back room, now!
- Come on, move, move!

  
Let's get in the back, huh?

  
Brooks. I lost visual on the hostages.
I couldn't get them out.

  
But I know who the leader is. It's Veck.

  
Veck? The trainee?

  
- No. The brainee.
- I don't believe this.

  
I'll pass it on to Howard.

  
Oh, God.

  
Trapped is fine by me.

  
Commence tanning. Three, two, one.

  
Yeah!

  
Yes!

  
Time for some big-game hunting.

  
Open, open, open! Thank God.

  
Oh, no.

  
Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! We get it!

  
Get him! Get him! Get him!

  
You better run.

  
- Rudolph, where are you?
- I'm about to end this.

  
Amy, huh? What a coincidence.

  
We got a cute little redhead
down at the bank named Amy.

  
- Strawberry blonde, actually.
- Yeah?

  
Well, I guess I know who I'm killing first.

  
- Catch you later!
- Yeah?

  
Well, it looks like you just ran out of mall.

  
It'll be over quick. She won't feel a thing.

  
You aren't gonna touch her,
but you are gonna feel this.

  
Nobody wins with a head butt.

  
- Give me your cell phone.
- I don't have one.

  
What are you talking about?
Every kid has a cell phone.

  
I prefer handwritten sentiments.

  
Who are these sloppy joes for?
And who gave you this?

  
They're mine.
I'm late for my shift at Foot Locker.

  
We're getting the leader on the horn.
He wants to talk to you.

  
Silence, my ass.

  
What's the matter?
Throw a few jabs your way,

  
you curl up in a corner, suck your thumb?

  
If you don't go toe-to-toe
with that scumbag,

  
he's gonna roll over on you all night long.

  
It's all right. That's not my style.

  
Well, just in case, I wrote down
a couple of clever comebacks, like...

  
Here.

  
This is what you been doing?

  
"Yeah, you and what army?"

  
- What's wrong with that?
- He has an army.

  
Everyone deserves a card on their birthday.

  
So when you and Rudolph
were laughing it up back at the crib

  
about how easy all this was gonna be,
were you guys like,

  
"Man, any brain-dead mall cop
that gets in the way is gonna get smoked"?

  
And then... And then what?
You guys all high-fived?

  
- Veck, this guard is...
- Winning! I know this, because I am all set!

  
But sadly, no codes!

  
And I'd say, considering
all the luxury items that I have stacked up

  
in my Amazon shopping cart,
situation unacceptable!

  
No, no, no, no, no, no. He looking.

  
Give me a gun.

  
Put it down. Put it down.

  
What are you nodding about?

  
I was just wondering,
were you serious about that Happy Meal?

  
It isn't coming, is it?

  
What?

  
This is Commander James Kent,
New Jersey SWAT.

  
You wanted to speak to me?

  
I just wanna make sure
that no one does anything stupid.

  
You should know my men are deployed
and ready to bring this thing to a resolution.

  
The easy way or the hard way.

  
That is such a tough call, but...

  
Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and go with C,
none of the above!

  
I'm Amy, by the way.

  
- Amy? From unbeWEAVEable?
- Yeah.

  
I'm Maya.
My father talked forever about you.

  
And I gotta say, he really does like you.

  
I'm gonna throw up.

  
Oh, that's not so bad.

  
Oh, my God.

  
They've got his daughter.

  
- Dad?
- Maya.

  
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- How's your blood sugar?

  
Don't worry about me, okay?
I'm worried about you.

  
I love you.
All right, now, I'm gonna get you all out.

  
You just hang in there, okay, sweetie?

  
I will. I'm a Blart, remember?

  
Yeah. I'll see you soon.

  
I'm supposed to be on my way
to the Cayman Islands with the hostages.

  
And where the hell is Rudolph?
He should be back by now.

  
"If Veck gets the codes,
he's taking us to Cayman Islands"?

  
Well, Veck Sims, welcome to the show.

  
Come and get me, Veck.

  
I got your codes
for the credit-card machines.

  
- Yo, you hear that? That's Paul, baby!
- Blart?

  
That's who's been screwing all this up?
You have got to be kidding me.

  
Give me a radio.

  
Let me tell you something.

  
You take hostages in my mall,
you are making a big mistake.

  
You seriously undermissed...

  
And you seriously...

  
Oh, no!

  
Blart?

  
Sugar. Sugar.

  
Blart? You there, Blart?

  
Hello, Blart. You there?

  
Hey, Blart!

  
I was hoping we could get an ETA
of when you're gonna give up.

  
How about now?

  
I'll meet you on the corner of Ne and Ver.

  
Yeah, you heard me. Never!

  
All right, Dad.

  
Hey, fellas! You looking for me?

  
Come on. Come on, come on. Come on.

  
Follow me.

  
There he is.

  
We got him trapped in Rainforest Cafe.

  
Great. Wait for me.
You know, my mom always said,

  
"If you want something done right,
waste the guy yourself."

  
I'm paraphrasing, of course. You stay here.

  
Prancer, take the back.

  
Hey, you. Scuba Dooby-Doo.

  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Can I have my codes now, please?

  
Why? No codes, no Cayman Islands?

  
Looks like Paul Blart turned into
quite the badass.

  
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Relax.

  
No.

  
One thing I know is
Paul Blart is not a badass.

  
Comet! Don't come back till he's dead!

  
Brooks. Only one more left.
Then it's just me and Veck.

  
Okay, who's talking to Blart?

  
Was it you, sugar mouth?

  
All right. Let's try this again.

  
Wait! No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no!

  
It's her phone, it's hers.
She's talking to him.

  
She's talking to him, and I told her not to.
And it's under her leg.

  
The phone. Her right leg. Right there.
That's good.

  
Okay.

  
That was close.

  
He is a pro.

  
Listen, Blart, time's up. We're busting in.

  
Wait! Look, Veck's after
the credit-card codes, and I got them.

  
Just give me a few minutes.

  
No problem.

  
Isn't that cute?

  
- Hey, Amy. I'm on my way.
- Oh, hey, Blart.

  
Wow. Our boy Stuart just turned me on
to your profile

  
on lonelyloser.com.

  
"Likes morning rain, walks on the beach."

  
Who are you, Olivia Newton-John?

  
I was just speaking from the heart.

  
Yeah, well, I didn't have to go online, Paul,
to know that you love peanut brittle.

  
You're so pathetic.

  
Trippy.

  
This I can use.

  
What do you want, Veck?

  
I just want the $30 million
that I came here for.

  
But, you know, I would settle offing
your dream girl, or maybe your daughter.

  
You touch them, I swear I'll end you.

  
What're you gonna do, Paul?

  
You gonna pull up with your left hip forward
giving the illusion that you have a gun,

  
which you and I both know you don't?

  
- I could.
- You're not gonna do squat.

  
The next time I see you, Paul,
I'm gonna put a bullet in your head.

  
I don't think so. I'm taking you down.

  
Blart!

  
Oh, Blart.

  
Sweet mercy.

  
I wish I had a bat. I would bust you open,
see how much candy fell out.

  
- Too tight!
- This is not happening.

  
- It's not happening.
- Come on.

  
Bravo. That was awesome.

  
And you were just so close
to making it, too, Paul. Just so close.

  
- It's not over yet.
- Yeah, I think it is.

  
Now the only thing I need are my codes,
which, judging from your text messages,

  
you have been so sweet as to enter them
into your phone just for me.

  
You think I'm gonna carry the phone
with me that actually contains the...

  
- Yello?
- Peanut Blart and Jelly.

  
What's up, man?
So good to hear your voice.

  
Yeah, it's good to hear
your voice, too, Pahud.

  
Listen, I'm gonna have to call you back.

  
- What? When?
- I don't know when. I'll talk to you later.

  
Okay, Paul, call me back!
Call me back, Paul!

  
I mean,
this just keeps getting better and better.

  
I mean, you are impossible
to underestimate.

  
I mean, you can't pass the trooper exam,

  
you black out if you don't have
a Snickers bar like every 20 minutes,

  
you had the chance to be the MVP,
and you blew it.

  
Again, like you always do.
Ain't that right, Maya?

  
What do you want me to say, Veck?
You're smarter than me.

  
You're good on computers,
you kept your weight under control.

  
I mean, people,
they look at me and you, and...

  
Yeah, it's a landslide.

  
It's no contest.

  
Sorry.

  
Right now, you're the man with the gun.

  
So here you go.

  
Come on!

  
Go get him!

  
Go, Dad.

  
What...

  
Probably should have capitalized on that.

  
Dad!

  
Lock and load, boys. We're going in.

  
Hey, we're on the move.

  
Let's go.

  
Come on, come on, come on.

  
Paul. Think, Paul. Think!

  
Let's go, men. Take it down.
Secure the suspects.

  
Get down!

  
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

  
Down. The other one. That's the back one.

  
No, no. That's the same one. No!
The other one!

  
Veck got away with my daughter and Amy.

  
Entry team, clear the mall. We'll pursue.

  
Light.

  
Open the door.

  
Let's do this.

  
Jimmy, give me your cell phone.

  
Gotta hand it to you, Blart.
You're really taking care of business.

  
What up?

  
Pahud, do you still have GPS
on Parisa's cell phone?

  
You know I do, Paul. You know I do.
What can I do for you?

  
I need to know where it's headed.

  
Paul, it looks like
they're on their way to McGuire Airfield.

  
I know where that is. Thanks.

  
Hang on.

  
My God. There they are.
Jimmy, take the wheel.

  
What?

  
Here we go! Here we go!

  
That was me. I can't...

  
Here I go! No!

  
Blart!

  
Don't do it! Blart!

  
Oh, God. Oh, God.

  
Maya! Maya, get inside.

  
- Oh, God!
- Dad!

  
Paul?

  
I really don't drink.

  
Come on. Oh, yeah?

  
- Dad!
- Come on.

  
Dad!

  
Man, that hypoglycemia is a killer.

  
I told you I'd take you down.

  
Blart!

  
Very impressive,
taking down an assailant without a gun.

  
I hope you don't mind if I use one.

  
What?

  
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

  
I guess
it's off to the Cayman Islands then, huh?

  
Soon as I get my money.

  
Yeah, well, you'll be needing this.

  
Just give it to him, Dad.

  
Oh, I will. Suck on that!

  
Okay. Situation update?

  
We have seven assailants in custody, sir.

  
- Great. Nobody talks to them but me.
- Yes, sir.

  
You see, jackass? I don't need the phone.

  
'Cause I got all the access codes
written on their arm.

  
Now, I kill you three,
there'll be no witnesses.

  
And since everybody thinks
this was a bank...

  
I got a newsflash for you.
Your flight's been canceled.

  
That's better than anything I got.

  
You did good, Dad.

  
Yeah, I am pretty great.

  
You know, she doesn't need a green card.

  
I don't know what to say.

  
I have something I want to say to you.

  
Happy birthday, Amy.

  
I heard you applied to be a state trooper.

  
You say the word,
my department would be proud to have you.

  
Thank you, sir. But I think
I'm gonna stick with what I do best.

  
It's protecting the people
of the West Orange Pavilion Mall.





(man) Peter was a courageous boy,
but that dawn he could feel fear
stick to his skin like dew on leaves.
The fog was thick enough
to make him lose his way home.
Then he began to hear strange noises
coming from the depths of the forest.
He noticed a presence,
small shadows that seemed to giggle
as they followed in his footsteps.
- (boy) Who were they, Grandpa?
- Cruel, deformed forest dwellers,
haughty creatures,
spiteful and impudent.
They are the vengeful and evil goblins -
the little people of the night.
What did they want with him?
What did Peter do to the goblins?
That's the point. Goblins don't
need to justify their cruel acts.
They are evil creatures.
But let me go on, please.
OK. I won't interrupt you any more.
To make a long story short,
Peter started to run and run
and run.
(grunting and grumbling)
Poor Peter remained on the ground
unconscious for a long time.
Finally, when he opened his eyes,
he saw in front of him,
just a few inches away from him...
A goblin?
She was a lovely girl
with huge eyes the colour of the sea.
She looked at him kindly,
her expression full of love.
Peter immediately fell in love with her.
She caressed him and offered him
something to eat and drink.
The strange concoction
she offered him was delicious.
Peter ate and drank
without ever taking his eyes off her.
He was bewitched by that gaze,
and it was that look that deceived him.
I bet it was a goblin in disguise.
Those evil creatures can transform
themselves into flesh and blood people,
whenever and however they want.
You're making a mistake, Grandpa.
You said they can.
You should have said they could,
or what kind of fairy tale is it?
They can. They can.
Goblins still exist.
Your Grandpa Seth is telling you.
And... how did Peter end up?
He began to feel ill, very ill.
He was sweating chlorophyll green.
- (boy) Green?
- That's right.
The colour of the goblins.
The colour of sap.
Then she appeared to him
as she really was -
horrible and mocking.
Changed into what?
Half man, half plant.
The goblins' favourite food.
Food? Don't tell me
they ate him, Grandpa!
That's exactly what happened,
with a voracity
that has no equal on Earth.
What are you doing still up, Josh?
Grandpa Seth was telling me a sto...
(sighs)
Still telling the same story, Josh?
I know, Mommy. I told you
it would never happen again.
But, you see, it's not a dream for me.
I see him in front of me
and he's so real.
He tells me stories, just like before.
Grandpa Seth has been gone for over
six months now. You were at the funeral.
I know it was very difficult for you.
It was also very difficult for your
father, Holly and me, his daughter.
He was an amazing man.
Grandpa Seth has remained
in all our hearts,
but you must banish him
from your mind.
- Remember what the doctor said?
- Of course.
Grandpa Seth is just an invention
of my subconscious.
That's right.
- But he's so real...
- That's enough. Try to go to sleep.
We're going on a vacation tomorrow.
A month in the country will do us
all good. Good night, dear.
- Good night, dear.
- Mom?
- Yes?
- Do goblins exist?
No, dear. They don't exist.
Now, try to go to sleep.
(man) Yeah, John. That's Nilbog,
right. Spell it? N-l-L-B-O-G.
We'll be gone around a month.
Can you take care
of that business while we're gone?
Yeah? That's great. OK.
See ya, John. All right, bye.
- Are the kids sleeping?
- No. They're more awake than we are.
They're probably excited about the trip.
Do you know how many people
live in Nilbog?
- No. How many?
- 26, including the Presents.
- Isn't that wonderful?
- Come on to bed.
Just think, we'll be living like
our ancestors did.
Yeah, we'll be peasants and farmers,
just like people did a century ago.
- Hey, what's the matter?
- I'm worried about Joshua.
He's still seeing Grandpa Seth.
When I was a kid,
I had an imaginary playmate.
It wasn't your dead grandfather.
It'll end. This trip will make him
forget about your father.
- Michael?
- Yeah?
Who are the goblins?
The goblins? (laughs)
(tapping)
(laughter)
- Sh! You fell! What a jerk!
- He pointed the light right at me!
Goblins don't exist. Goblins
don't exist. Goblins don't exist.
(screeches)
Elliot!
What kind of idiotic joke is this?
You scared the shit out of me.
I'm the victim of a nocturnal rapture.
I have to release my lowest instincts
with a woman.
Release your instincts in the bathroom!
- Are you trying to turn me into a homo?
- It wouldn't be too hard.
If my father discovers you here,
he'd cut off your little nuts and eat them.
He can't stand you!
And... And you?
I like you.
But my family doesn't like you.
They say you spend
way too much time with your friends.
Oh, oh, but I swear I never see them.
- How long is this gonna take?
- We're sick of waiting.
Won't you come to Tonino's,
Holly, for some pizza?
Hey, these are cute!
(all complain)
- Do you see?
- What's wrong with having friends?
Nothing, if you wanna
remain a virgin for life.
You take them to bed with you,
and I don't believe in group sex.
Is your family
going on vacation tomorrow?
- Yes.
- I'll come with you?
OK, I'll tell my father
you're coming with us.
- Where are we going?
- Nilbog.
A wonderful half-empty town.
It's an exchange.
A family from the country is coming here
and we're going to live in their house.
Oh, Elliot, it will be wonderful.
You and me, in the woods.
This time, we'll be able
to be together for sure.
And my boys?
If you bring them,
I never wanna see you again.
OK. I'm going now and I'll tell them.
I'll see you tomorrow morning?
- At eight on the dot.
- OK.
- Elliot?
- Yeah.
- Alone?
- Of course.
I'll see you tomorrow morning.
Finally!
Please don't do this, Holly.
We could have waited
another 15 minutes.
I'm sure he would've come.
We left at 9.30,
an hour and a half off schedule.
- We never saw a sign of your beau.
- Elliot's not my beau.
He's my boyfriend.
He told me last night that he loves me
and that he wanted to come
with my family.
- Evidently he preferred his friends to you.
- That's not true.
Yes, it is. Listen to reason.
Elliot is a good-for-nothing.
Stop it, both of you.
I have no intention of having
my vacation ruined just for this.
I never liked that kid. I never did.
I'm the one who has to like him, Dad.
Me, alone.
Stop it, please!
Joshua, start singing. Come on.
Sing that song I like so much.
- I don't feel like singing, Mom.
- Just sing.
Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
life is but a dream
Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
life is but a dream
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
life is but a dream
Where the hell is Nilbog?
It's not even marked on the map.
It's gotta be there somewhere.
Just look closer, dudes.
Here it is, but it's just a speck.
- Sure it's full of beautiful girls?
- Lots of 'em. Pretty and unattached.
Oh, yeah!
Whoo!
I don't feel good.
Stop the car, Dad. I'm sick!
You stuffed yourself like a pig, Joshua!
I'd really love to see you get sick!
You ate too much.
Dad, stop the car.
Joshua's ready to be eaten!
(growling)
- No! Don't eat me!
- Joshua!
Was I dreaming?
Who wanted to eat you, little brother?
Nobody.
We're only a few miles away, Josh.
Speaking of eating,
do you want some, Joshua?
No, thanks.
- Stop the car, Daddy. Stop!
- What's wrong, Josh?
- Do you have to throw up?
- Yes. I have to throw up.
- What are you doing here, Grandpa?
- What are all of you doing here?
- You have to make them go back.
- Why?
You're getting yourselves into big trouble.
This is a bad place, little one.
It even gives me the creeps.
Can't you tell me more, Grandpa?
What are you doing, Joshua?
So how about it?
Are you gonna give me a ride or not?
Get in the car, Joshua. Come on! Hurry!
Come on! Get in!
Holly!
Come on! Holly! Quick!
- That was them, right?
- Yeah, right. She just...
- Why didn't Holly stop them?
- I don't think this was a good idea.
- Shut up! I'm in charge, not her.
- Yeah, says you!
- There's no one here.
- It's normal.
It's a farming community. At this
time of night everybody goes to sleep.
- Where's the farm?
- Over there.
Now, remember, we're the farmer Waits.
We're country people.
- Dad?
- What, Josh?
I don't like this place.
Can we go home?
- What?
- Don't listen to him.
- Lead the way, Farmer Waits.
- OK.
Fresh air! Country air!
Hello.
- You're late.
- I'm sorry. We had a small mishap.
- Here are the keys.
- Um, here are ours.
Enjoy your stay in Nilbog.
Enjoy our city, too.
You'll enjoy our city.
It has some smog and it's a little noisy,
but our house
has all the major conveniences.
It's got a microwave and video.
All the other appliances.
- Yeah.
- A refrigerator, a bar.
People of few words.
Come on. Let's go in.
Joshua? You coming?
- Yeah, not bad!
- I'm hungry.
They've probably left something
behind, I'd be willing to bet.
Come take a look, everyone!
Typical country hospitality.
Let's dig in.
- (father) I am so hungry.
- (mother) Here, have some of this.
Here, try this. That looks good...
- Grandpa!
- Don't let them eat, Joshua.
For the love of God, don't let them eat!
Aren't you hungry, Joshua?
Most of this stuff is green.
How weird.
Stop them, Joshua.
You're the only one that can do it.
If they eat, they'll come to
the same end as Peter in the story.
But how can I stop them?
OK, you have 30 seconds
to come up with some way to stop them.
I must do it!
I must do it! I must do it!
No, Daddy! Please!
Don't hit him, Michael.
Please don't hit him!
Why not? It's what he deserves -
a big spanking for a little shit.
Joshua is not a little shit.
He's just very sensitive.
This smells!
Do you see this writing?
Do you know what it means?
Hospitality,
and you can't piss on hospitality.
- I won't allow it!
- What are you going to do, Daddy?
Tighten my belt
so I don't feel hunger pains.
Your sister and mother will do likewise.
OK, Joshua. You want to get rough?
You wanna show that you don't like
this house by going on hunger strike?
I'll accept the challenge, but when I was
your age I really did suffer from hunger.
We'll see who gets through this,
but I've got more practice.
I'll see you tomorrow.
(explosions on television)
I'm sick of this. Where are
the unattached horny girls, Elliot?
Don't be a pain in the neck, Arnold.
We just got here.
I'm going outside
for a breath of fresh air.
Hey, Arnold. If you find any twins,
don't be greedy.
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
Ma'am? Please stop.
Stop, I say.
Hey! Please stop!
Excuse me, ma'am!
Stop!
Stop, stop, I say!
- Who are you?
- Who are you?
- Are you one of the monsters?
- I've been called a lot of things.
- But not a monster.
- You're human?
Very human. You wanna see?
- Are you sick?
- They made me eat that stuff.
- I think I'm dying.
- They who?
- Who are you talking about?
- There they are!
(growling)
- Uh, what are they?
- Monsters!
- What do you want from me?
- Uh... Wait here.
Wait here. I'll take care of 'em.
(throaty growls)
Let me give you some advice, you dwarfs.
Get out of here or
you're going to be in a lot of trouble.
(growls intensify)
- What do we have to do?
- And remember...
(ferocious growling)
Did you guys hear that yell?
It was probably just Arnold
deflowering a Nilbog virgin.
No, that wasn't the scream
of a woman. That was Arnold.
Well, then, it was probably a girl
from Nilbog deflowering Arnold.
Probably!
(cries out)
Let's get out of here! Quick!
Let's hide in this house.
What kind of a place is this?
This is my house!
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am Creedence Leonor Gielgud,
of ancient druid origins.
My ancestors came from Stonehenge.
Am I mistaken or is there something
wrong with the two of you?
We... We need a doctor, ma'am.
Please call the nearest hospital.
There is no hospital in Nilbog.
We are used to curing ourselves.
Here we are.
This broth
is miraculous.
It contains sap from the forest.
It is a concentration of all
the vegetal properties of the earth.
Drink of it.
Children!
My poor children!
(cries out)
(splutters)
What's wrong? What's wrong with her?
Don't worry about her.
Drink your broth.
(moaning)
- I can't move! Why?
- You talk too much for me.
What's happening? Why can't I move?
There must be a logical reason.
Shut up!
She's... She's changing!
She is purifying herself.
Now she is one
with the vegetable world.
- (screams)
- Now she is food for my children.
Oh!
Make yourselves comfortable!
Dinner is ready.
They're eating her.
And then they're going to eat me!
(voracious gobbling)
Oh, my God!
I don't like this place, not one bit.
(dance music plays)
(music stops)
Dear Elliot Cooper.
Tomorrow morning
will be your final judgment.
Either me or your boys.
Take it or leave it.
The beautiful Holly Waits
or your lovely little boys.
Make a choice, Elliot!
Joshua! Joshua!
Mom!
Dad!
Mom! Mom!
What is it? What's the matter?
- What's wrong?
- I saw him.
- Who? Who did you see?
- Grandpa Seth.
See? It wasn't me this time!
It was a reflection in the mirror.
It was him. Grandpa Seth
was calling out to Joshua.
I'm tired of this.
Come with me, all of you.
So where's that damn mirror?
It's right... It's right there.
Look, there's no one other than us.
But he was there before.
It's gotta be your imagination
or a hallucination.
- Are you still smoking dope, Holly?
- I swore I wouldn't, Dad.
I want to get up early in the morning.
We're still farmers, right?
I am not sleeping in this room.
- Didn't you hear what your father said?
- I'm not sleeping here.
I'll sleep here.
- You would really do that for me?
- Sure.
Why not? I'm not afraid.
- Good night, son.
- Good night, Josh. Thank you.
Good night, Josh. Now, go to sleep!
Grandpa! Grandpa Seth! Are you here?
- What happened?
- You were in the wrong room!
Holly was sleeping there.
I still have to learn
the layout of this house.
I'm glad to see you, Grandpa.
Did you see?
I managed to keep them from eating.
Now, you have to convince them
to leave here.
This is an evil place.
It is the kingdom of the goblins.
But why don't you tell my mommy
and daddy these things?
They don't listen to me.
Your mother has never taken my advice.
That's why she married
that good-for-nothing.
(crackling)
The powers of evil are very strong here.
I must leave.
But I'll be back, Joshua.
I'll be back.
Grandpa? Only you
can do something. Only you.
Damn! There's no milk.
There's no coffee. There's nothing.
- Didn't anyone remember to get supplies?
- We left in too much of a hurry, Drew.
- Go into town. Do the shopping now.
- With what? I don't have any money.
- Just take it out of the group fund.
- OK.
Is breakfast ready, dear?
There's nothing in the whole house.
No eggs, no bacon.
There's just a lot of milk,
but it's all like this.
It must be a week old.
Good morning, Mom. Good morning, Dad.
- (Holly) What's for breakfast?
- Nothing.
What? I'm hungry enough
to eat a horse.
I've been fasting for two days.
Josh and I will run into town
to the general store. Right, Josh?
- OK.
- We won't be gone long.
- Hello, son.
- Hi.
Are you in training?
- No. Just goin' shopping.
- Hop in. You'll save your breath.
OK. Thanks.
- I'm Sheriff Gene Freak.
- Oh, nice to meet you, Sheriff.
Are you just passing through Nilbog?
I'm on vacation with some friends.
We parked our camper on the road.
- Are you hungry?
- Well, a little bit. Yeah.
(eerie music drowns out voices)
- Thanks. It's good.
- I'm sure you'll all enjoy Nilbog.
We're hospitable people,
especially to strangers.
Here's the general store.
Oh, where do the girls around here
go at night?
Ha-ha! The girls! That's good!
(laughs raucously)
- Can I help you?
- Coffee.
There's no coffee here in Nilbog.
It's the Devil's drink!
Eggs.
- Eugh!
- Bacon.
Are you crazy, boy?
We're vegetarians here in Nilbog.
Didn't you know that?
Here's some Nilbog milk.
Special milk, high in vitamin content.
- Here, it's free.
- Free?
Of course it's free.
We love tourists here in Nilbog.
Try some, boy. And have some
of your friends drink some also.
Thank you.
D'you feel all right?
Yeah.
- Hey, you.
- Yeah?
- Your friend has a message for you.
- Who? Arnold?
Yeah. He said to meet him in the house
that looks like an old church.
OK.
You can go through the woods.
It's only about a mile away.
Good morning, my little flower.
Oh!
No need to worry about the closed mouth.
You didn't have anything to say anyway.
Right?
With this you will become strong
and beautiful.
Now, I am going to welcome
our new neighbours.
I have just prepared this pudding
with wild nettles
and a few organic additives
to make it delicious
and purify the intestines.
See you later, my little flower.
We have to wait and be patient.
Grandpa! Grandpa Seth! Are you there?
Nilbog! It's "goblin" spelt backwards!
This is their kingdom.
Good morning.
I am your neighbour.
- I am Creedence Leonor Gielgud.
- Good morning.
Mom, I'm going for a walk.
- Hello, beautiful!
- Hi.
She is very
- appetising.
- Appetising?
Provocative.
I thought you might enjoy
one of my ancient recipes.
It's a traditional dish in these parts.
You shouldn't have gone
to so much trouble.
No trouble.
Really.
The lowest instincts
are spreading in a horrifying way.
All men, especially men from the cities,
are letting themselves succumb
to the vices of meat...
The flesh.
The decaying part of the body.
It is so material and repulsive.
Repulsive!
They're still here!
Symbol of original sin,
which has consumed and
caused the fall of the human race
which is so dear to us.
Flesh!
And by flesh I mean
all that stinking, disgusting meat.
- (everyone) Eugh.
- Hamburgers!
- Eugh!
- Steaks, the steak sausages!
And hot dogs,
sold by the side of the road.
The stink of smoked carcasses.
Eugh!
(groaning)
The humans nourish themselves
with these,
violating their own bodies,
infecting themselves,
creating uncurable ailments.
- Smelly bladders.
- Eugh!
Nests of infection.
- Clusters of haemorrhoids!
- Eugh!
Vicious, stinking
excrement!
Vicious, stinking...
Argh!
Elliot? Elliot!
Holly. What a surprise.
Choose, Elliot. Either me or your friends.
I don't understand.
D'you understand now?
Is it ready?
Here it is. Nice and creamy.
This is a wonderful cup of Nilbog
ice cream for a little child.
You're going to stuff yourself
with it, aren't you?
Kids with a sweet tooth like yours
love ice cream.
Help, Grandpa Seth! Help!
(everyone) Mm.
Open your mouth, my little friend.
Please, open it.
(Joshua) I won't! I don't want to!
(everyone) Mm!
Open your mouth, my little friend.
Please, open it!
Mmmm!
No, I won't! I don't want to!
Joshua!
Stop!
What are you doing to my son?
- We were giving him some ice cream.
- Daddy, they're goblins!
- Monstrous beings!
- What?
They were giving me ice cream
so they could eat me later.
An active imagination.
A bit morbid, isn't he?
Look! They all have a mole
the shape of a clover leaf!
And Nilbog is "goblin" spelt backwards.
I'm telling you, Daddy. They're monsters.
Mr and Mrs Presents,
what are you doing here?
You were supposed to be at my house.
We had car trouble.
We'll be leaving this evening.
OK.
It was nice meeting... meeting all of you.
My son and I must be leaving now.
We need time
for some things to happen.
We must have patience until tonight.
- Christ!
- What?
Your sister Holly's
with that playboy son of the Coopers.
- They're my friends!
- Who do you think you are?
- Don't ever hit me again.
- Stop it!
Oh, no!
- So, kids, how's life?
- Listen, Mr Waits...
I don't speak to people who arrive late
and upset their girlfriends.
- You've given me a bad impression.
- Come on, Dad.
- We'll talk, Holly. OK?
- We need to have a serious talk.
Forget about your friends and
come to our house, or forget about Holly.
- All right. I'm coming.
- Elliot!
- You're gonna leave me here alone?
- Yes.
- What do I tell Drew and Arnold?
- Whatever you want.
- What am I gonna do?
- Take the camper. Do what you want.
What about the beautiful liberated girls?
Is anyone here?
Shit!
I'm so dizzy.
(muffled cries)
(muffled) Drew!
Drew, look at me!
Drew!
- Arnold?
- (muffled cries)
Is that you?
- Arnold, what's happened?
- (muffled cries)
- (unintelligible)
- What?
- Get me outta here, Drew. Get me out.
- OK. OK, don't fret.
Hurry, before that crazy lady gets back.
Grab the pot and drag me out quick!
I'll try.
(strains)
Hurry.
Hurry!
- What's wrong? Why did you stop?
- I don't feel so good.
You've gotta do it, man.
Grab hold and pull with all your strength.
- We can get out of this nightmare.
- Hello!
Oh, no.
You were thinking of leaving us,
little flower?
No! Please, ma'am.
You will be punished for this!
(motor starts)
No! Please, ma'am. I beg you.
What are you gonna do to me with that?
I'm going to make a nice milkshake
for your friend.
But this won't hurt you.
You'll just feel a little tickle,
little flower.
(chuckles)
(country music)
What's going on here?
(hum of conversation)
(jolly country music)
(people sing along)
Oh, Michael!
Look what a surprise
they have prepared for us!
Finally! I am so hungry.
- What are you doing here, Elliot?
- Elliot's part of the family now.
Oh, Elliot!
What a pleasure to see you again,
Mr Waits.
We wanted to make up
for the misunderstanding we had.
Look! All the people of Nilbog
have decided to give you a party.
- We even have a little food.
- A little?! They've prepared a whole feast!
Dance, my children! Dance and eat!
- Eat!
- No! Don't eat this stuff!
They're monsters! They're all monsters!
If you eat this stuff, they'll kill us.
They're goblins.
Joshua! I've had enough. I want you
to go to your room immediately.
Children's fantasies. They will pass.
Of course.
Grandpa! Grandpa Seth! Grandpa!
Grandpa! Grandpa Seth! Answer me!
Grandpa Seth! Come quick!
Grandpa Seth!
(growls)
Help, Grandpa Seth! Help!
(squeals)
(piercing scream)
Grandpa!
We must move quickly to put out the fire.
What fire?
Guess.
(wails)
That is enough!
(country music continues)
We'll go around the house. When the time
comes, light the wick and throw the bottle.
I'll create some confusion with this.
Hurry! Let's put some fuel on the fire.
Cut it out, kid.
You'll never be able to stop us.
And as for you, old man,
go back to your kingdom of shadows.
I order you, for the sacred power
of the magic stone
and its lord,
go back to hell!
(Joshua) Grandpa!
Hang on!
Grandpa! Grandpa!
Joshua, you'll have to do it yourself!
Are you really in hell?
No.
But I know a sacred spell
a friend who was there taught me.
- What happened?
- (screams)
- Grandpa!
- (cries out)
Jesus!
(coughing)
Oh, my God! What is this?
He was one of us and you killed him!
Now it's your turn!
Joshua!
Quick, get in the house!
Oh, Lord of the magic rock of Stonehenge!
Come and protect your children!
Come and give us strength!
(wind howls)
Give me all my old powers,
oh, Lord of the magic rock!
There's sandwiches for tonight in here.
It will go easier if you eat 'em.
You'll make our work easier.
Otherwise, we'll be forced
to kill you violently!
It would be a shame!
The blood would mix with the meat.
We'd have to put them in vinegar
for the whole night.
Dear God! What can we do?
We don't even have enough weapons
to defend ourselves.
- Do something, Elliot! Please!
- I don't know what to do.
- We need Grandpa Seth here!
- Joshua, Grandpa Seth is dead.
I know he's dead, but up till now
he's been the one helping us.
But how do we get him to come?
By holding a seance, maybe?
You're a genius, big sister!
(music on television)
(static)
Oh!
What the hell is wrong with this thing?
(raunchy music)
Do you like it?
Shall we eat it together?
What kind of show is this?
I'm not a programme.
I'm real.
Come out, and you'll see.
(music continues outside)
- Won't you invite me in?
- Uh, yeah.
Yeah, uh, of course.
Do you like it?
(music stops)
What's the matter?
Aren't you hungry?
Uh... Actually I like popcorn.
Oh, well, no problem.
All we have to do is heat it up.
Nothing's happening.
Raise your hands.
Concentrate harder!
Grandpa Seth, come to us.
Let's show 'em we're still here!
Don't get distracted!
Concentrate harder.
Grandpa Seth, please come.
I don't like this.
Why don't they show any sign of life?
Grandpa, please come and help us.
(wind howls)
(Seth) Joshua! Joshua!
D-Dad!
- That's not possible!
- I knew you wouldn't leave us, Grandpa.
- That's the voice of your grandpa?
- Yes.
We have only ten minutes.
When that clock starts striking six,
I'll disappear.
And now it is forever.
Together, we can destroy the magic stone
that gives the goblins their power.
Concentrate, Joshua. Concentrate!
Yes, Grandpa.
Joshua?
Joshua? Joshua!
(growls)
Quick! Upstairs!
(roaring and growling)
Michael!
Grandpa!
Grandpa Seth, are you here?
(creaking)
Elliot! Help!
(squeals)
Go away, monster!
(growls)
Quick! Run!
Grandpa, where have you been?
Take this. Keep it.
You can only take out the contents
when you really need it.
- Do you understand?
- I understand.
And now?
Here it is - the Stonehenge magic stone.
The goblins' magic power.
What do we have to do, Grandpa?
Touch it. Only touch it.
Will it work?
I hope so.
(throaty growl)
Please, let's talk.
We're all humans here.
No more! No more popcorn.
(piercing scream)
Our queen is calling us.
Joshua is alone right now. Let's go.
Grandpa! Nothing's happening.
Something has happened now, Joshua.
- (clock strikes)
- I'm leaving.
Oh, no, Grandpa. Not now.
Joshua, I have to do this once again.
Remember, it's only the power of
goodness that can defeat the goblins.
Goodbye forever.
Goodbye, Grandpa.
Goodbye.
Argh!
What were you going to do, little one?
(evil laugh)
Get off!
And now,
we are going to feed you,
Joshua.
You've been fasting two days.
You're hungry,
right?
A double-decker baloney sandwich!
(gasps)
Don't do it!
Think about the fat in your blood!
Think about the cholesterol.
Think about the toxins!
Oh! No!
No!
Joshua!
Grandpa Seth's voice brought us here.
Quick, help me. Put your hands
on the stone and concentrate.
- What?
- Don't you see?
Only the power of goodness
can destroy these monsters.
- Put your hands on the stone.
- (ferocious growling)
Concentrate!
Concentrate more!
Concentrate!
Ingrate!
(screaming stops)
- I have to pass by the office.
- I need to go home for a while.
- I'll come with you.
- Joshua and I will wait for you at home.
Want some fruit, Joshua?
The fruit is still very good.
I don't want to eat for the next 20 years.
Mm. It's delicious!
- I'm going to my room to take a nap.
- Good idea.
I think I'll take a shower first.
(sighs)
I don't know how to thank you, Grandpa.
I hope you're OK up there.
(whispering) Joshua. Joshua.
(eerie whisperings)
(shower running)
Mom?
Mommy!
Mommy!
Mommy!
They're eating my mom!
Do you want some, Joshua?





 {Man} Once upon a time there was a lovely princess.

But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only 

be broken by love's first kiss.

She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing 

dragon.

Many brave knigts had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, 

but non prevailed.

She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest 

tower for her true love and true love's first kiss.

{Laughing} 

Like that's ever gonna happen.

{Paper Rusting, Toilet Flushes}

What a load of - 



Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me

I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed

She was lookin' kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb

In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

The years start comin' and they don't stop comin'

Fed to the rules and hit the ground runnin'

Didn't make sense not to live for fun

Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

So much to do so much to see

So what's wrong with takin' the backstreets

You'll never know if you don't go

You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey, now You're an all-star

Get your game on, go play

Hey, now You're a rock star

Get the show on, get paid

And all that glitters is gold

Only shootin' stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder

You're bundled up now but wait till you get older

But the meteor men beg to differ

Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin

The water's getting warm so you might as well swim

My world's on fire

How 'bout yours

That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

Hey, now, you're an all-star

{Shouting}

Get your game on, go play

Hey, now You're a rock star

Get the show on, get paid

And all that glitters is gold

Only shootin' stars break the mold

{Belches}

Go!

Go!

{Record Scratching}

Go. Go.Go.

Hey, now, you're an all-star

Get your game on, go play

Hey, now You're a rock star

Get the show on, get paid

And all that glitters is gold

Only shootin' stars break the mold



-Think it's in there?

-All right. Let's get it!

-Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?

-Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.

{Laughs}

-Yes, well, actually, that would be a gaint.

Now, ogres - - They're much worse.

They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin.

-No!

-They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes!

Actually, it's quite good on toast.

-Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!

{Gasping}

-Right.

{Roaring}

{Shouting}

{Roaring}

{Whispers} This is the part where you run away.

{Gasping}

{Laughs}

{Laughing} And stay out!

"Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."

{Sighs}

{Man's voice} All right. This one's full.

-Take it away!

{Gasps}

-Move it along. Come on! Get up!

-Next!

-Give me that! Your fiying days are over.

That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next!

-Get up! Come on!

-Twenty pieces.

{Thudding}

-Sit down there!

-Keep quiet!

{Crying}

-This cage is too small.

-Please, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again.

I can change. Please! Give me another chance!

-Oh, shut up.

-Oh!

-Next!

-What have you got?

-This little wooden puppet.

-I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy.

-Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away.

-Father, please! Don't let them do this!

-Help me!

-Next! What have you got?

-Well, I've got a talking donkey.

{Grunts}

-Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it.

-Oh, go ahead, little fella.

-Well?

-Oh, oh, he's just - - He's just a little nervous.

He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt - -

-That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!

-No, no, he talks! He does. I can talk. I love to talk.

I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw.

-Get her out of my sight.

-No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!

{Gasps}

-Hey! I can fly!

-He can fly!

-He can fly!

-He can talk!

-Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey.

You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly

but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha!

Oh-oh.

{Grunts}

-Seize him!

-After him! He's getting away!

{Grunts, Gasps}

{Man}

-Get him! This way! Turn!

-You there. Orge!

-Aye?

-By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under 

arrest

and transport you to a designated..... resettlement facility.

-Oh, really? You and what army?

{Gasps, Whimpering}

{Chuckles}

-Can I say something to you?

-Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. 

Incredible!

Are you talkin' to - - me? Whoa!

-Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great 

back here? Those guards!

They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They 

was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made 

me feel good to see that.

-Oh, that's great. Really.

-Man, it's good to be free.

-Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? 

Hmm?

-But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by 

myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. 

You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit 

out of anybody that crosses us.

{Roaring}

-Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that 

don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you 

definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks!

You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time - - 

{Mumbling}

Than I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases eking out of my 

butt that day.

-Why are you following me?

-I'll tell you why. 



'Cause I'm all alone

There's no one here beside me

My promlems have all gone

There's no one to deride me

But you gotta heve friends - - 



-Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends.

-Wow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest.

-Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I?

-Uh - - Really tall?

-No! I'm an orge! You know. "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't 

that bother you?

-Nope.

-Really?

-Really, really.

-Oh.

-Man, I like you. What's you name?

-Uh, Shrek.

-Shrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek?

You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing.

I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. Whoo! Look at that. 

Who'd want to live in place like that?

-That would be my home.

-Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a 

decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I 

like that boulder. That is a nice boulder.

-I guess you don't entertain much, do you?

-I like my privacy.

-You know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I 

hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them 

a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence.

-Can I stay with you?

-Uh, what?

-Can I stay with you, please?

-Of course!

-Really?

-No.

-Please! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to 

be considered a freak. Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta 

stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!

-Okay! Okay! But one night only.

-Ah! Thank you!

-What are you - - No! No!

-This is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, 

and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles.

-Oh!

-Where do, uh, I sleep?

-Outside!

-Oh, well. I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you 

don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know.

{Sniffles}

-Here I go.

-Good night.

{Sighs}

-I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. 

I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, 

outside.



I'm all alone

There's no one here beside me

{Bubbling}

{Sighs}

{Creaking}

{Sighs}

-I thought I told you to stay outside.

-I'm outside.

{Clattering}

-Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we 

have? 

-It's not home, but it'll do just fune.

-What a lovely bed.

-Got ya.

{Sniffs} I found some cheese.

-Ow! {Grunts}

-Blah! Awful stuff.

-Is that you, Gorder?

-How did you know?

-Enough! What are you doing in my house?

{Grunts}

-Hey!

{Snickers}

-Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table.

-Where are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken.

-Huh?

{Gusps}

{Male voice} What?

-I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying orge! What do I 

have to do get a little privacy?

-Aah!

-Oh, no. No! No!

{Cackling}

-What?

-Quit it.

-Don't push.

{Squeaking}

{Lows}

- What are you doing in my swamp?

{Echoing}

Swamp! Swamp! Swamp!

{Gasping}

-Oh, dear!

-Whoa!

-All right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! 

Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey!

-Quickly. Come on!

-No, no! No, no. Not there. Not there.

-Oh!

{Sighs}

-Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them.

-Oh, gosh, no one invited us.

-What?

-We were forced to come here.

-By who?

-Lord Farquaad.

-He huffed und he puffed und he...... signed an eviction notice.

{Sighs}

-All right. Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?

{Murmuring}

-Oh, I do. I know where he is.

-Does anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all?

-Me! Me!

-Anyone?

-Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me!

{Sighs}

-Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. 

Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy 

Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came 

from!

{Cheering}

{Twittering}

-Oh! You! You're comin' with me.

- All right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two 

stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it!

-On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek.

-Hey. Oh, oh!

-I can't wait to get on the road again.

-What did I say about singing?

-Can I whistle?

-No.

-Can I hum it?

-All right, hum it.

{Humming}



{Grunts}

{Whimpering}

-That's enough. He's ready to talk.

{Coughing}

{Laughing}

{Clears throat}

-Run, run, run, as fust as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the 

gingerbread man!

-You are a monster.

-I'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy 

tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the 

others?

-Eat me!{Grunts}

-I've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached 

its end! Tell me or I'll - -

-No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons.

-All right then. Who's hiding them?

-Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man?

-The muffin man?

-The muffin man.

-Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane?

-Well, she's married to the muffin man.

-The muffin man?

-The muffin man!

-She's married to the muffin man.

{Door opens}

-My lord! We found it.

-Then what are you waiting for? Bring it in.

{Man grunting}

{Gasping}

-Oh!

-Magic mirror - - 

-Don't tell him anything!

-No!

{Ginerbread man whispers}

-Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect 

kingdom of them all?

-Well, technically you're not a king.

-Uh, Thelonius.

-You were saying?

-What I mean is, you're not a king yet. But you can become one.  All 

you have to do is marry a princess.

-Go on.

{Chuckles}

-So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to 

meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette 

number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. 

She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking 

and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella.

-Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of 

fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just 

kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come 

on. Give it up for Snow White!

-And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a 

fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling 

lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes 

pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, 

Princess Fiona!

-So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or 

bachelorette number three?

-Two! Two!

-Three! Three!

-Two! Two!

-Three! 

-Three? One?

{Shudders} Three?

--Three! Pick number three, my lord!

-Okay, okay, uh, number three!

-Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona.



If you like pina coladas

And getting caught in the rain



-Princess Fiona.



If you're not into yoga



-She's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go - - 

-But I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night.

-I'll do it.

-Yes, but after sunset - -

-Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will 

finally have the perfect king!

Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament.



-But that's it. That's it right there. That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd 

find it.

-So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle.

-Uh-huh. That's the place.

-Do you think maybe he's compensating for something?

{Laughs}

{Groans}

-Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.

-Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry.

-Hey, you!

{Screams}

-Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just - - I just - -

{Whimpering}

{Sighs}

{Whimpering, Groans}

{Turnstile clatters}

{Chuckles}

{Sighs}

-It's quiet. Too quiet.

{Creaking}

-Where is everybody?

-Hey, look at this!

{Clattering, whirring, clicking}

Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town

Here we have some rules

Let us lay them down

Don't make waves, stay in line

And we'll get along fine

DuLoc is perfect place

Please keep off of the grass

Shine your shoes, wipe your... face

DuLoc is, DuLoc is

DuLoc is perfect ...... place

{Camera shutter clicks

{Whirring}

-Wow! Let's do that again!

-No. No. No, no, no! No.

{Trumpet fanfare}

{Crowd cheering}

-Brave knights.

-You are the best and brightest in all the land.

-Today one of you shall prove himself - -

-All right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom.

-Sorry about that.

{Cheering}

-That champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go 

forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the 

dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first 

runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you mae 

die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make.

{Cheering}

-Let the tournament begin!

{Gasps}

-Oh!

-What is that?

{Gasping}

-It's hideous!

-Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey.

-Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the orge will be named 

champion! Have it him!

-Get him!

-Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now.

-Go ahead! Get him!

-Can't we just settle this over a pint?

-Kill the beast!

-No? All right then. Come on!



I don't give a damn about my reputation

You're living in the past 

It's a new generation



-Damn!

{Whinnying}



A girl can do what she wants to do

And that's what I'm gonna do

And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation

Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not me

Me, me, me



-Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!



And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation

Never said I wanted to improve my station



-Ah!

{Laughs}



And I'm always feelin' good when I'm having fun



-Yeah!



And I don't have to please no one



-The chair! Give him the chair!



And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation

Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not me

Me, me, me

Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not me, not me

{Bell dings}

{Cheering}

{Laughs}

-Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till 

Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha!

{Shrek laughs}

{Crowd gasping, murmuring}

-Shall I give the order, sir?

-No, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion!

-What?

-Congratulations, orge. You're won the honor of embarking on a great 

and noble quest.

-Quest? I'm already in a quest, a quest to get my swamp back.

-Your swamp?

-Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those tale creatures!

{Crowd murmuring}

-Indeed. All right, orge. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for 

me, and I'll give you your swamp back.

-Exactly the way it was?

-Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.

-And the squatters?

-As good as gone.

-What kind of quest?

-Let me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a 

princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only 

don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place.

-Is that about right?

-Maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk.

-I don't get it. Why don't you just pull some of that orge stuff on 

him? Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make 

your bread, the whole orge trip.

-Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village and 

put their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and 

drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you?

-Uh, no, not really, no.

-For your information, there's a lot more to orges than people think.

-Example?

-Example? Okay, um, orges are like onions.

-{Sniffs} They stink?

-Yes - - No!

-They make you cry?

-No!

-You leave them in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little 

white hairs.

-No! Layers! Onions have layers. Orges have layers! Onions have 

layers. You get it? We both have layers. 

{Sighs}

-Oh, you both have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know, not everybody likes 

onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers.

-I don't care... what everyone likes. Orges are not like cakes.

-You know what else everybody likes? Parfaits. Have you ever met a 

person, you say, "Let's get some parfait," they say, "No, I don't like 

no parfait"? Parfaits are delicious.

-No! You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden! Orges are like 

onions! And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later.

-Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet.

-You know, I think I preferred your humming. Do you have a tissure or 

something? I'm making a mess. Just the word parfait make me start 

slobbering.



I'm on my way from misery to happiness today

Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

I'm on my way from misery to happiness today

Uh-huh,uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

And everything that you receive up yonder

Is what you give to me the day I wander

I'm on my way 

I'm on my way 

I'm on my way 



-Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that?

-You gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was 

open. Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. {Sniffs} It's 

brimstone We must be getting close.

-Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking about it's the brimstone. I 

know what I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It didn't come off no stone 

neither.

{Rumbling}

-Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location.

{Laughing}

-Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said orges have layers?

-Oh, aye.

-Well, I have a bit of a confession to make. Donkeys don't have 

layers. We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves.

-Wait a second.  Donkeys don't have sleeves.

-You know what I mean.

-You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.

-I'm just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over 

a boiling like of lava!

-Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside ya, okay? For emotional 

support., we'll just tackle this thing together one little baby step 

at a time.

-Really?

-Really, really.

-Okay, that makes me feel so much better.

-Just keep moving. And don't look  down.

-Okay, don't look  down. Don't look  down. Don't look  down. Keep on 

moving. Don't look  down.

{Gasps}

-Shrek! I'm lookin' down! Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me off, 

please! 

-But you're already halfway.

-But I know that half is safe!

-Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back.

-Shrek, no! Wait!

-Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance then, shall me?

-Don't do that!

-Oh, I'm sorry. Do what?

-Oh, this?

-Yes, that!

-Yes? Yes, do it. Okay.

{Screams}

-No, Shrek! No! Stop it!

-You said do it! I'm doin' it.

-I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die. Oh!

-That'll do, Donkey. That'll do.

-Cool.

-So where is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway?

-Inside, waiting for us to rescue her.

{Chuckles}

-I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.

{Water dripping, wind howling}

-You afraid?

-No.

-But - -

- Shh.

-Oh, good. Me neither.

{Gasps}

-'Cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible 

response to an unfamiliar situation. Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I 

might add. With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and 

breathes fire, it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little 

scared. I sure as heck ain't no coward. I know that.

{Gasps}

-Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. Now go over there and see if 

you can find any stairs.

-Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for the princess.

-The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest 

tower.

-What makes you think she'll be there?

-I read it in a book once.

-Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle the stairs. I'll find those 

stairs. I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs won't know which way 

they're goin'.

{Creacing}

-I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it to the curb. Don't mess with 

me. I'm the stair master. I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a 

step right here. I'd step all over it.

-Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where's the - - 

-Dragon!

{Screams}

{Gasps}

{Roars}

-Donkey, look out!

{Screams}

{Whimpering}

-Got ya!

{Roars}

{Gasps}

{Shouts}

-Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

{Screaming}

{Gasps}

-Oh! Aah! Aah!

{Gasping}

{Crowls}

-No. Oh, no, No!

{Screams}

-Oh, what large teeth you have.

{Crowls}

-I mean white, sparkling teeth. I know you probably hear this all time 

from your food, but you must bleach, 'cause that is one dazzling smile 

you got  there. Do I detect a hint of minty freshness? And you know 

what else? You're - - You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! I mean, of 

course you're a girl dragon. You're just reeking of feminine beauty. 

What's the matter with you? You got something in your eye? Ohh. Oh. 

Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know, I'm, uh - - 

(Coughs)

-I'm an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd work out if you're gonna 

blow smoke rings. Shrek!

{Gasps}

{Whimpering}

-No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

{Groans, Sighs}

{Vocalizing}

-Oh! Oh!

-Wake up!

-What?

-Are you Princess Fiona?

-I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me.

-Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!

-But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our first meeting. Should it not be 

a wonderful, romantic moment?

-Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.

-Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should sweep me off my feet out 

yonder window and down a rope onto your valiant steed.

-You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you?

-Mm-hmm.

{Screams, grunts}

-But we have to savor this moment! You could recite an epic poem for 

me. A ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!

-I don't think so.

-Can I at least know the name of my champion?

-Um, Shrek.

-Sir Shrek.

{Cleans throat}

-I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.

-Thanks!

{Roaring}

-You didn't slay the dragon?

-It's on my to-do list. Now come on!

{Screams}

-But this isn't right! You were meant to charge in, sword drawn, 

banner flying. That's what all the other knights did.

-Yeah, right before they burst into flame.

-That's not the point. Oh!

-Wait. Where are you going? The next's over there.

-Well, I have to save my ass.

-What kind of knight are you?

-One of a kind.

-Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. I believe it's healthy to get to 

know someone over a long perriod of time. Just call me old-fashioned. 

{Laughs}

-I don't want to rush into a physical relationship. I'm not 

emotionally ready for a commitment of, uh, this - -  Magnitude really 

is the word I'm looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that is unwanted 

physical contact. Hey, what are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just back 

up a little and take this one step at a time. We really should get to 

know each other first as friends or pen pals. I'm on the road a lot, 

but I just love receiving cards - -  I'd really love to stay, but - - 

Don't do that! That's my tail! That's my personal tail. You're gonna 

tear it off. I don't give permission - - What are you gonna do with 

that? Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. No, no, no. No! Oh!

{Growls}

{Roaring}

{Gasps}

-Hi, Princess!

-It talks!

-Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's the trick.

{Screams}

{Screaming}

-Oh!

{Thuds}

{Groans}

{Roars}

{Roaring}

-Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll take care of the dragon.

{Fchoing}

-Run!

{Gasping}

{Screaming}

{Roaring}

{Screams}

{Roars}

{Panting, sighs}

{Whimpers}

{Roars}

-You did it!

-You rescued me! You're amazing. You're - - You're wonderful. 

You're... a little unorthodox I'll admit. But they deed is great, and 

thine heart is pure. I am eternally in your debt. 

{Clears throat}

-And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed?

-I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed. She think I'm a 

steed.

-The battle is won. You may remove your helmet, good Sir Knight.

-Uh, no.

-Why not?

-I have helmet hair.

-Please. I would'st look upon the face of my rescuer.

-No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st.

-But how will you kiss me?

-What? That wasn't in the job description.

-Maybe it's a perk.

-No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know how it goes. A princess locked in 

a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight, and then 

they share true love's first kiss.

-Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait. Wait. You think that Shrek is you 

true love?

-Well, yes.

{Laughing}

-You think Shrek is your true love!

-What is so funny?

-Let's just say I'm not your tipe, okay?

-Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. Now - - Now remove your 

helmet.

-Look. I really don't think this is a good idea.

-Just take off the helmet.

-I'm not going to.

-Take it off.

-No!

-Now!

-Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness.

-You- - You're a- - an orge.

-Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.

-Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed 

to be an orge.

{Sighs}

-Princess, I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the 

one who wants to marry you.

-Then why didn't he come rescue me?

-Good question. You should ask him that when we get there.

-But I have to be rescued by my true love, not by some prge and his- - 

his pet.

-So much for noble steed.

-You're not making my job any easier.

-I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. You can tell Lord Farquaad 

that if he wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right 

here.

-Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all right? I'm a delivery boy.

-You wouldn't dare. Put me down!

-Ya comin', Donkey?

-I'm right behind ya.

-Put me down, or you will suffer the consequences! This is not 

dignified! Put me down!

-Okay, so here's another question. Say there's a woman that digs you, 

right, but you don't really like her that way. How do you let her down 

real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned to a 

crisp and eaten?

-You just tell her she's not your true love. Everyone knowest what 

happens when you find your - -  Hey!

{Sighs}

-The sooner we get to DuLoc the better.

-You're gonna love it there, Princess. It's beautiful!

-And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? What's he like?

-Let me put it this way, Princess. Men of Farquaad's stature are in 

short supply.

{Laughs}

-I don't know. There are those who think little of him.

-Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're just jealous you can never 

measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.

-Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess. But I'll let you do the 

"measuring" when you see him tomorrow.

-Tomorrow? It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop to make camp?

-No, that'll take longer. We can keep going.

-But there's robbers in the woods.

-Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camping's starting to sound good.

-Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this 

forest.

-I need to find somewhere to camp now!

{Birds wings fluttering}

{Grunting}

-Hey! Over here.

-Shrek, we can do better than that. I don't think this is fit for a 

princess.

-No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches.

-Homey touches? Like what?

{Crashing}

-A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night.

-You want me to read you a bedtime story? I will.

-I said good night!

-Shrek, What are you doing?

{Laughs}

-I just- - You know - - Oh, come on. I was just kidding.

{Fire cracking}

-And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only orge to ever spit over 

three wheat fields. Right. Yeah.

-Hey, can you tell my future from these stars?

-The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look, 

there's Bloodnut, the Flatulent. You can guess what he's famous for.

-I know you're making this up.

-No, look. There he is,  and there's the group of hunters running away 

from his stench.

-That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots.

-You know, Donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. Hmm? 

Forget it.

{Sighs}

-Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?

-Our swamp?

-You know, when we're through rescuing the princess.

-We? Donkey, there's no "we". There's no "our". There's just me and my 

swamp. The first thing I'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall arond my 

land.

-You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real deep just now. You know what 

I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody 

out.

-No, do ya think?

-Are you hidin' something?

-Never mind, Donkey.

-Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it?

-No, this is one of those drop-it and leave-it alone things.

-Why don't you want to talk about it?

-Why do you want to talk about it?

-Why are you blocking?

-I'm not blocking.

-Oh, yes, you are.

-Donkey, I'm warning you.

-Who you trying to keep out?

-Everyone! Okay?

-Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere.

-Oh! For the love of Pete!

-What's your problem? What you got against the whole world anyway?

-Look, I'm not the one with the problem, okay? It's the world that 

seems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and go. 

"Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly orge!" They judge me before they 

even know me. That's why I'm better off alone.

-You know what? When we met, I didn't think you was just a big, 

stupid, ugly orge.

-Yeah, I know.

-So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?

-Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small and Annoying.

-Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny one, right there. That one 

there?

-That's the moon.

-Oh, okay.



{Orchestra}

{Dulcimer}

-Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the 

princess.

-Hmph.

-Ah. Perfect.

{Inhales}



{Snoring}

{Vocalizing}

{Whistling}

{Sizzling}

{Sniffs, yawns}

-Mmm, yeah, you know I like it like that.

--Come on, baby. I said I like it.

-Donkey, wake up.

-Huh? What?

-Wake up.

-What?

-Good morning. Hm, how do you like your eggs?

-Good morning, Princess!

-What's all this about?

-You know, we kind of got off to a bad start yesterday. I wanted to 

make it up to you. I mean, after all, you did rescue me.

-Uh, thanks.

{Sniffs}

-Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us.

{Belches}

-Shrek!

-What? It's a compliment. Better out than in, I always say. {Laughs}

-Well, it's no way to behave in front of a princess.

{Belches}

-Thanks.

-She's as nasty as you are.

-{Laughs} You know, you're not exactly what I expected.

-Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them.

{Vocalizing}



-La liberte! Hey!

-Princess!

{Laughs}

-What are you doing?

-Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior! And I am rescuing you from 

this green - -

{Kissing sounds}

-beast.

-Hey!

-That's my princess! Go find you own!

-Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a little busy here?

-Look, pal, I don't know who you think you are!

-Oh! Of couse! Oh, how rude. Please let me introduse myself. Oh, Merry 

Men. 

{Laughs}



{Accordion}

Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo.

I steal from the rich and give to the needy.

He takes a wee percentage, 

But I'm not greedy. I rescue pretty damsels

Man, I'm good

What a guy, Monsieur Hood

Break it down

I like an honest fight

and a saucy little maid

What he's basically saying

is he likes to get - - 

Paid

So

When an orge in the bush

grabs a lady by the tush

That's bad

That's bad

When a beauty's with a beast

it makes me awfully mad

He's mad

He's really, really mad

I'll take my blade and

ram it through your heart

Keep your eyes on me, boys

'cause I'm about to start



{Grunts, Groans}

{Merry Men Gasping}

-Man, that was annoying!

-Oh, you little- -

{Accordion}

{Shouting, groaning}

{Chuckles}

-Uh, shall we?

-Hold the phone.

{Grunts}

Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come from?

-What?

-That! Back there. That was amazing! Where did you learn that?

-Well - - {Chuckles} When one lives alone, uh, one has to learn these 

things in case there's a - - There's an arrow in your butt!

-What? Oh, would you look at that?

-Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so sorry.

-Why? What's wrong?

-Shrek's hurt.

-Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die.

-Donkey, I'm okay.

-You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm too young for you to die. Keep 

you legs elevated. Turn your head and cough. Does anyone know the 

Heimlich?

-Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help Shrek, run into the woods and 

find me a blue flower with red thorns.

-Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns. 

Don't die Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light!

-{Both} Donkey!

-Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns.

-What are the flowers for?

-For getting rid of Donkey.

-Ah.

-Now you hold still, and I'll yank this thing out.

-Ow! Hey! Easy with the yankin'.

-I'm sorry, but it has to come out.

-No, it's tender.

-Now, hold on.

-What you're doing is the opposite of help.

-Don't move.

-Look, time out.

-Would you - - 

{Grunts}

-Okay. What do you propose we do?

-Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red 

thorns. This would be so much easier if I wasn't color-blind! Blue 

flower, red thorns.

-Ow!

-Hold on, Shrek! I'm comin'!

-Ow! Not good.

-Okay. Okay. I can nearly see the head.

{Grunts}

-It's just about - - 

-Ow! Ohh!

-Ahem.

-Nothing happend. We were just, uh - - 

-Look, if you wanted to be alone, all you had to do was ask. Okay?

-Oh, come on! That's the last thing on my mind. The princess here was 

just- - Ugh! 

-Ow!

-Hey, what's that?

{Nervous chickle}

-That's- - Is that blood?

{Sighs}

{Bird chirping}

{Grunts}



My beloved monster and me

We go everywhere together

Wearin' a raincoat

that has four sleeves

Gets us through all kinds of weather



-Aah!



She will always be the only thing

That comes between me and the awful sting

That comes from living in a world

that's so damn mean

{Croaks}

Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

-Hey!

La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la

{Both laughing}

La-la, la-la, la-la



-There it is, Princess. Your future awaits you.

-That's DuLoc?

-Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for 

something,  which I think means he has a really - - Ow!

-Um, I, uh- -  I guess we better move on.

-Sure. But, Shrek? I'm - - I'm worried about Donkey.

{Blubbering}

-What?

-I mean, look at him. He doesn't look so good. 

-What are you talking about? I'm fine.

-That's what they always say, and then next thing you know, you're on 

your back. Dead.

-You know, she's right. You look awful. Do you want to sit down?

-Uh, you know, I'll make you some tea.

-I didn't want to say nothin', but I got this twinge in my neck, and 

when I turn my head like this, look, 

{Bones crunch}

-Ow! See?

-Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner.

-I'll get the firewood.

-Hey, where you goin'? Oh, man, I can't feel my toes! I don't have any 

toes! I think I need a hug.



-Mmm. This is good. This is really good. What is this?

-Uh, weedrat. Rotisserie style.

-No kidding. Well, this is delicious.

-Well, they're also great in stews. Now, I don't mean to brag, but I 

make a mean weedrat stew.

{Chuckling}

{Sighs}

-I guess I'll be dining a little differently tomorrow night.

{Gulps}

-Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime. I'll cook all kind 

of stuff for you. Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare - - you name it.

{Chuckles}

-I'd like that.

{Slurps, laughs}



See the pyramids along the Nile



-Um, Princess?



Watch the sunrise from a tropic isle



-Yes, Shrek?

-I, um, I was wondering.



Just remember, darling all the while



-Are you- - 



You belong to me



{Sighs} 

-Are you gonna eat that?

{Chuckles}

-Man, isn't this romantic? Just look at that sunset.

-Sunset?

-Oh, no! I mean, it's late. I-It's very late.

-What?

-Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on here. You're afraid of the dark, 

aren't you?

-Yes! Yes, that's it. I'm terrified. You know, I'd better go inside.

-Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to be afraid of the dark, too, until 

- - Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark.

{Shrek sighs}

 -Good night.

 -Good night.

{Door creaks}

-Ohh! Now I really see what's goin' on here.

-Oh, what are you talkin' about?

-I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm an animal, and I got instincts. 

And I know you two were diggin' on each other. I could feel it.

-You're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.

-Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the pheromones. Just go on in 

and tell her how you feel.

-I- - There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that, 

well, you know - - and I'm not sayin' I do 'cause I don't - - she's a 

princess, and I'm - - 

-An orge?

-Yeah. An orge.

-Hey, where you goin'?

-To get... move firewood.

{Sighs} 



-Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess, where are you?

{Wings fluttering}

-Princess?

{Creaking}

{Gasps}

-It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing no games.

{Screams}

-Aah!

-Oh, no!

-No, help!

-Shh!

-Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

-No, it's okay. It's okay.

-What did you do with the princess?

-Donkey, I'm the princess.

-Aah!

-It's me, in this body.

-Oh, my God! You ate the princess. Can you hear me?

-Donkey!

-Listen, keep breathing! I'll get you out of there!

-No!

-Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

-Shh.

-Shrek!

-This is me.

{Muffled mumbling}

-Princess? What happened to you? You're, uh, uh, uh, different.

-I'm ugly, okay?

-Well, yeah! Was it something you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats 

was a bad idea. You are what you eat, I said. Now - - 

-No.

-I - - I've been this way as long as I can remember.

-What do you mean? Look, I ain't never seen you like this before.

-It's only happens when sun goes down.

"By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm... until you 

find true love's first kiss... and then take love's true form."

-Ah, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry.

-It's a spell.

{Sighs} 

-When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every night I 

become this. This horrible, ugly beast! I was placed in a tower to 

await the day my true love would rescue me. That's why I have to marry 

Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets and he sees me like this.

{Sobs}

-All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad. You're not 

that ugly. Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly. But you only look 

like this at night. Shrek's ugly 24-7.

-But Donkey, I'm a princess, and this is not how a princess is meant 

to look.

-Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry Farquaad?

-I have to.  Only my true love's kiss can break the spell.

-But, you know, um, you're kind of an orge, and Shrek - - well, you 

got a lot in common.

-Shrek?



-Princess, I - - Uh, how's it going, first of all? Good? Um, good for 

me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower and thought of you because it's 

pretty and - - well, I don't really like it, but I thought you might 

like it 'cause you're pretty. But I like you anyway. I'd - - uh, uh - 

- 

{Sighs}

-I'm in trouble. Okay, here we go.

-I can't just marry whoever I want. Take a good look at me, Donkey. I 

mean, really, who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly? 

"Princess" and "ugly" don't go together. That's why I can't stay here 

with Shrek.

{Gasps}

-My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love.

{Deep sigh}

-Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be. It's the only 

way to break the spell.

-You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.

-No! You can't breathe a word. No one must ever know.

-What's the point of being able to talk if you gotta keep secrets?

-Promise you won't tell. Promise!

-All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should. I just know 

before this is over, I'm gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy.

-Look at my eye twitchin'.

{Door opens}

{Snoring}

-I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him. 

-Shrek! Shrek, there's something I want - - 

{Snoring}

-Shrek. Are you all right?

-Perfect! Never been better.

-I - - I don't - - There's something I have to tell you.

-You don't have to tell me anything, Princess. I heard enough last 

night.

-You heard what I said?

-Every word.

-I thought you'd understand.

-Oh, I undersatnd. Like you said, "Who could love a hideous, ugly 

beast?" 

-But I thought that wouldn't matter to you.

-Yeah? Well, it does.

{Gasps, sighs}

-Ah, right on time.

{Horse whinnies}

-Princess, I've brought you a little something.

{Fanfare}

{Yawns}

-What'd I miss? What'd I miss?

{Muffled}

-Who said that? Couldn't have been a donkey.

-Princess Fiona.

-As promised. Now hand it over.

-Very well, orge. The deed to your swamp, cleared out, as agreed.

-Take it and go before I change my mind.

-Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, for I 

have never seen such a radiant beauty before. I'm Lord Farquaad.

-Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no.

{Snaps fingers}

-Forgive me, my lord, for I was just saying a short... farewell.

-Oh, that is so sweet. You don't have to waste good manners on the 

orge. It's not like it has feelings.

-No, you're right. It doesn't.

-Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawerss Fiona. I ask your hand in 

marriage.

{Gasps}

-Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom?

-Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make - - 

-Excellent! I'll start the plans, for tomorrow we wed!

-No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let's get married today before the sun 

sets.

-Oh, anxious, are you? You're right. The sooner, the better. There's 

so much to do! Threre's the caterer, the cake, the band, the guest 

list. Captain, round up some guests!

-Fare-thee-well, orge.

-Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting her get away.

-Yeah? So what?

-Shrek, there's something about her you don't know. Look, I talked to 

her last night, She's - - 

-I know you talked to her last night. You're great pals, aren't ya? 

Now, if you two are such good friends, why don't you follow her home?

-Shrek, I - - I wanna go with you.

-I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me. I live alone! 

My swamp! Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, 

pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!

-But I thought - - 

-Yeah. You know what? You tought wrong!

-Shrek.



I heard there was a secret chord

That David played and it pleased the Lord

But you don't really care for music, do ya

It goes like this the fourth, the fifth

The minor fall the major lift

The baffled king composing hallelujah

Hallelujah,  hallelujah

Baby, I've been here before

I know this room I've walked this floor

I used to live alone before I knew you

I've seen your flag on the marble arch

But love is not a victory march

It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah,  hallelujah

And all I ever learned from love

Is how to shoot at someone

Who outdrew you

{Moaning}

And it's not a cry you can hear at night

It's not somebody who's seen the light

It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

{Moaning}

Hallelujah,  hallelujah



{Thumping sound}

-Donkey?

{Grunts}

-What are you doing?

-I would think, of all people, you would recognize a wall when you see 

one.

-Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not 

through it.

-It is around your half. See that's your half, and this is my half.

-Oh! Your half. Hmm.

-Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work. I 

get half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks 

like your head.

-Back off!

-No, you back off.

-This is my swamp!

-Our swamp.

-Let go, Donkey!

-You let go.

-Stubborn jackass!

-Smelly orge.

-Fine!

-Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through with you yet.

-Well, I'm through with you.

-Uh-uh. You know, with you it's always, "Me, me, me!" Well, guess 

what! Now it's my turn! So you just shut up and pay attention! You are 

mean to me. You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do! 

You're always pushing me around or pushing me away.

-Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?

-Because that's what friends do! They forgive each other!

-Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive you... for stabbin' me in 

the back!

-Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of your 

own feelings.

-Go away!

-There you are , doing it again just like you did to Fiona. All she 

ever do was like you, maybe even love you.

-Love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous creature. I heard the two of 

you talking. 

-She wasn't talkin' about you. She was talkin' about, uh, somebody 

else.

-She wasn't talking about me? Well, then who was she talking about?

-Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything. You don't wanna listen to me. 

Right? Right?

-Donkey!

-No!

-Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right?

{Sighs}

-I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly orge. Can you 

forgive me?

-Hey, that's what friends are for, right?

-Right. Friends?

-Friends.

-So, um, what did Fiona say about me?

-What are you asking me for? Why don't you just go ask her?

-The wedding! We'll never make it in time.

-Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where, there's a will, there's a way and I 

have a way.

{Whistles}

-Donkey?

-I guess it's just my animal magnetism.

{Laughing}

-Aw, come here, you.

-All right, all right.Don't get all slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass. 

All right, hop on and hold on tight. I haven't had a chance to install 

the seat belts yet.

-Whoo!

{Bells tolling}

{All gasping}

-People of DuLoc, we gather here today to bear witnss to the union....

-Um-

-of our new king - -

-Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead to the "I do's"?

{Chuckling}

-Go on.

-Go ahead, HAVE SOME FUN. If we need you, I'll whistle. How about 

that? Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You wanna do this right, don't 

you?

-What are you talking about?

-There's a line you gotta wait for. The preacher's gonna say, "Speak 

now or forever hold your peace." That's when you say, "I object!"

-I don't have time for this!

-Hey, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me! Look, you love this 

woman, don't you?

-Yes.

-You wanna hold her?

-Yes.

-Please her?

-Yes!

-Then you got to, got to try a little tenderness. The chicks love that 

romantic crap!

-All right! Cut it out. When does this guy say the line?

-We gotta check it out.



-And so, by the power vested in me, 

-What do you see?

-The whole town's in there.

-I now pronounce you husband and wife,

-They're at the altar.

-king and queen.

-Mother Fletcher! He already said it.

-Oh, for the love of Pete!

{Grunts}

-I object!

-Shrek?

{Gasps}

-Oh, now what does he want?

-Hi, everyone. Havin' a good time, are ya? I love DuLoc, first at all. 

Very clean.

-What are you doing here?

-Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one wants you, but 

showing up uninvited to a wedding - -

-Fiona! I need to talk to you.

-Oh, now you wanna talk? It's a little late for that, so if you'll 

excuse me - - 

-But you can't marry him.

-And why not?

-Because- - Because he's just marring you so he can be king.

-Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.

-He's not your true love.

-And what do you know about true love?

-Well, I - - Uh - - I mean - - 

-Oh, this is precious. The orge has fallen in love with the princess! 

Oh, good Lord.

{Crowd laughting}

-An orge and a princess!

-Shrek, is this true?

-Who cares? It's preposterous! Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away 

from our "happily ever after." Now kiss me! Mmmmm!

-"By night one way, by day another." I wanted to show you before.

{Whimpers}

{Crown gasping}

-Well, uh, that explains a lot.

-Ugh! It's disgusting! Guards! Guards! I order you to get that out of 

my sight now! Get them! Get them both!

-No, no!

-Shrek!

-This hocus-pocus alters nothing. This marriage is binding, and that 

makes me king! See? See?

-No, let go of me! Shrek!

-No!

-Don't just stand there, you morons.

-Get out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh! 

-I'll make you regret the day we met. I'll see you drawn and 

quartered!

-You'll beg for death to save you!

-No, Shrek!

-And as for you, my wife,

-Fiona!

-I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days!

-I'm king!

{Whistles}

-I will have order! I will have perfection! I will have - - Aaaah!

-Aah!

-All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon here, and I'm not afraid to 

use it.

{Roars}

-I'm a donkey on the edge!

{Belches}

-Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they?

{Cheering}

-Go ahead, Shrek.

-Uh, Fiona?

-Yes, Shrek?

-I - - I love you.

-Really?

-Really, really.

- I love you too.

-Aawww!

-"Until you find true love's first kiss and then take love's true 

form."

-"Take love's true form. Take love's true form."

-Fiona? Fiona. Are you all right?

-Well, yes. But I don't understand. I'm supposed to be beautiful.

-But you ARE beautiful.

{Chuckles}

-I was hoping this would be a happy ending.



I thought love was only true in fairy tales

Oy!

Meant for someone else but not for me

Love was out to get me

That's the way it seemed

Disappointment haunted all my dreams

And then I saw her face

Now I'm a believer and not a trace

Of doubt in my mind

I'm in love

Ooh-aah

I'm a believer I couldn't leave her

If I tried



-God bless us, every one.



Come on, y'all!

Then I saw her face

Ha-ha

Now I'm a believer 

Listen!

Not a trace

Of doubt in my mind

I'm in love

Ooh-aah

I'm a believer 

I couldn't leave her if I tried

-Ooh!

-Uh!

Then I saw her face

Now I'm a believer 

Hey!

Not a trace

Uhh! Yeah.

Of doubt in my mind



-One more time!

I'm in love

I'm a believer 

Come on!

I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, 

I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, hey

Y'all sing it with me!

I

Believe

I believe

People in the back!

I believe

I'm a believer 

I believe

I believe

I believe

I believe

{Hysterical laughing}

-Oh, that's funny. Oh. Oh.

-I can't breathe. I can't breathe. 



I believe in self-assertion

Destiny or a slight diversion

Now it seems I've got my head on straight

I'm a freak an apparition

Seems I've made the right decision

To try to turn back now it might be too late



Now I want to stay home today

Don't wanna go out

If anyone comes to play

Gonna get thrown out

I wanna stay home today

Don't want no company

No way

Yeah, yeah, yeah



I wanna be a millionaire someday

But know what it feels like to give it away

Watch me march to the beat of my own drum

And it's off to the moon and then back again

Same old day Same situation

My happiness rears back as if to say



I wanna stay home today

Don't wanna go out

If anyone comes to play

Gonna get thrown out

I wanna stay home today

Don't want no company

No way

Yeah, yeah, yeah



I wanna stay home, stay home, stay home.........





I get such a thrill when you look in my eyes

My heart skips a beat

'Cause deep down inside all I wanted was you

that you are still mine

You always consider me

to keep my mind on

'Cause you had my mind gone

Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh

You're on my mind

I wanna be with you

'Cause when you're

It's like wow

And all your kisses

seem to set me free

you look at me

There's a smile

There's a truth

In your eyes

What an unexpected way

On this unexpected day

Could it be

This is where I belong

It is you I have loved

All long

There's no more mystery

It is finally clear to me

You're the home

my heart's searched for

So long

It is you I have loved

All long

Whoa, over and over

I'm filled with emotion

As I look

Into your perfect face








Im looking for people who actually really want to learn and be dedicated to it. only a handful have shown promise so far, id like to find more.
Why don't you people visit the scripter's forum?
The wiki is easy to understand if you have at least average competence.
Hi I would really like scripting lessons for a game I am trying to make maybe we could talk and I could get lessons?
My name is Raildex, I teach lessons in scripting to those who take an interest. I have had several students before however I am not currently teaching and am quite bored. If you want to learn scripting I can teach you. There are three conditions; 1) You must stick with it, you cant give up part way through. 2) If we setup lesson times, please try to be there. 3) Take an interest, show some initiative, try to solve on your own. Computer Science (scripting) is 75% problem solving so you'll need to get used to it, I wont always be there to tell you the answer. If you have any interest in this or have a question, reply to this post or PM me.
Is there a way to create a plugin that when you click it, it has a localscript that already has some source there.
What he described was a tycoon where you can hire people by beating them senseless so they are forced to work for you. They continue working for you out of fear of you, just trying to survive. You then order them to go extort money from the other teams, and they only get a small cut of the money they earn, the rest goes to the big kingpin, who can buy more things to cause more fear upon others gaining more power and reputation.
########### You can adjust the cut for them, at least! Plus, PERSUASION is also key. The greatest empirical dictators didn't become dictators through a very sharp object.
Don't tell me this doesn't sound like organized crime.
For example, if I clicked on my plugin, a LocalScript would pop up on starterpack with the source: --[[currenttime--]]
(currenttime is basically os.time)
and then whatever variables I wanted after that?
Just looking for someone who is able to volunteer to help with some minor problems. :) 
If you could just describe them here it would be better so everyone looking at this forum has a chance to help you. Plus I'm not even sure if I can help you I'm not the greatest scripter; depending on your problem.
Well I have multiple problems. First is how to make a save script to my inventory GUI, I don't know how to do that even with my knowledge.

Second, Is that how do I make my shop compatible with my minigames, like if someone buys a better item in the shop and they buy it, instead of spawning in with the item everyone gets they spawn in with the item they have equipted(Which I don't know how to make equipt an item either)
so i am trying to create a but i dont know how to make a custom character like in phantom forces beta all the player have there character which is created by the dev CAN SOME ONE HELP ME???
well jimmy it hasn't been easy, piano and wood cutting takes time and cutting a bunch of them, you know (lumberjacks) are the part of time that makes it not easy. I am very mad that professional golf players use a deck of cards a day, true known fact.  in fact did you know that hedge trimming is the best part of the side of a car without a door. well i don't because swimming is the best not of a sport. this is a comment. comment in fact, actually a fact that is in fact.
this is comment.
I've been trying everything since last night to get this to work, nothing has worked for me. I've googled stuff and tried it out and it's really hard because I've never iterated through tables like this.
I have this script that is meant to give the player a Mushroom if the player clicks the block the script is in and has enough coins. But it doesn't work!
You could try just doing it the old way by finding a Mushroom, Then make a shop (Look t the Guide to learn more.) 
Finding a guide for doing exactly what you want is not as easy as you think.

Me: look children it's your father.
Mom: what.
Me: what.

me: refreshed and excited over the prospect of a female hero who can engage the male villain in a brutal, violent fight, a fight that is not framed by sexist expectations, where the hero's strength is based on story telling and foreshadowing and not on her gender.
tumblr hellsite: friendly reminder :) the villain hurt a woman :) so he is a :) misogynist :) :) :) sorry i don't make the rules uwu.

Me: I have an opinion!

According to all known laws
of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Coming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?

  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

  
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can't just decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

  
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look at these two.

  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

  
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

  
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

  
What were you doing during this?

  
Trying to alert the authorities.

  
I can autograph that.

  
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

  
Yeah. Gusty.

  
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

  
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

  
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

  
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

  
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

  
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

  
Hey, Honex!

  
Dad, you surprised me.

  
You decide what you're interested in?

  
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

  
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

  
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

  
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

  
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

  
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

  
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

  
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

  
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

  
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

  
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

  
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

  
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

  
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

  
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

  
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

  
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

  
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!

  
I'm so proud.

  
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

  
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

  
Yeah, right.

  
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

  
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!

  
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.

  
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!

  
Wow!

  
Oouple of newbies?

  
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

  
Make your choice.

  
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.

  
Oh, my. What's available?

  
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

  
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

  
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

  
Wax monkey's always open.

  
The Krelman opened up again.

  
What happened?

  
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

  
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

  
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

  
Oh, this is so hard!

  
Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,

  
humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,

  
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?

  
Barry!

  
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...

  
What happened to you?
Where are you?

  
- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?

  
- Out there.
- Oh, no!

  
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.

  
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?

  
Another call coming in.

  
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd

  
that gets their roses today.

  
Hey, guys.

  
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?

  
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

  
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.

  
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

  
Sign here, here. Just initial that.

  
- Thank you.
- OK.

  
You got a rain advisory today,

  
and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.

  
So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,

  
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.

  
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.

  
Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!

  
- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,

  
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!

  
All right, launch positions!

  
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

  
Black and yellow!

  
Hello!

  
You ready for this, hot shot?

  
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

  
Wind, check.

  
- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.

  
- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.

  
Scared out of my shorts, check.

  
OK, ladies,

  
let's move it out!

  
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!

  
All of you, drain those flowers!

  
Wow! I'm out!

  
I can't believe I'm out!

  
So blue.

  
I feel so fast and free!

  
Box kite!

  
Wow!

  
Flowers!

  
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.

  
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.

  
Roses!

  
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.

  
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.

  
That is one nectar collector!

  
- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.

  
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,

  
a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.

  
That's amazing. Why do we do that?

  
That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.

  
Oool.

  
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?

  
Oopy that visual.

  
Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.

  
Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?

  
Affirmative.

  
That was on the line!

  
This is the coolest. What is it?

  
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.

  
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.

  
Yeah, fuzzy.

  
Ohemical-y.

  
Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.

  
My sweet lord of bees!

  
Oandy-brain, get off there!

  
Problem!

  
- Guys!
- This could be bad.

  
Affirmative.

  
Very close.

  
Gonna hurt.

  
Mama's little boy.

  
You are way out of position, rookie!

  
Coming in at you like a missile!

  
Help me!

  
I don't think these are flowers.

  
- Should we tell him?
- I think he knows.

  
What is this?!

  
Match point!

  
You can start packing up, honey,
because you're about to eat it!

  
Yowser!

  
Gross.

  
There's a bee in the car!

  
- Do something!
- I'm driving!

  
- Hi, bee.
- He's back here!

  
He's going to sting me!

  
Nobody move. If you don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!

  
He blinked!

  
Spray him, Granny!

  
What are you doing?!

  
Wow... the tension level
out here is unbelievable.

  
I gotta get home.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!

  
Ken, could you close
the window please?

  
Ken, could you close
the window please?

  
Oheck out my new resume.
I made it into a fold-out brochure.

  
You see? Folds out.

  
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.

  
What was that?

  
Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...

  
Drapes!

  
That is diabolical.

  
It's fantastic. It's got all my special
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.

  
What's number one? Star Wars?

  
Nah, I don't go for that...

  
...kind of stuff.

  
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
They're out of their minds.

  
When I leave a job interview, they're
flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.

  
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.

  
I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.

  
I predicted global warming.

  
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.

  
Wait! Stop! Bee!

  
Stand back. These are winter boots.

  
Wait!

  
Don't kill him!

  
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!

  
Why does his life have
less value than yours?

  
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?

  
I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capable of feeling.

  
My brochure!

  
There you go, little guy.

  
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.

  
Put that on your resume brochure.

  
My whole face could puff up.

  
Make it one of your special skills.

  
Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.

  
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.

  
- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.

  
- You could put carob chips on there.
- Bye.

  
- Supposed to be less calories.
- Bye.

  
I gotta say something.

  
She saved my life.
I gotta say something.

  
All right, here it goes.

  
Nah.

  
What would I say?

  
I could really get in trouble.

  
It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.

  
I can't believe I'm doing this.

  
I've got to.

  
Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!

  
No. Yes. No.

  
Do it. I can't.

  
How should I start it?
"You like jazz?" No, that's no good.

  
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

  
Hi!

  
I'm sorry.

  
- You're talking.
- Yes, I know.

  
You're talking!

  
I'm so sorry.

  
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.

  
But I don't recall going to bed.

  
Well, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.

  
This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!

  
I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,

  
but they were all trying to kill me.

  
And if it wasn't for you...

  
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.

  
That was a little weird.

  
- I'm talking with a bee.
- Yeah.

  
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!

  
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.

  
- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
- What?

  
The talking thing.

  
Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.

  
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.

  
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

  
Anyway...

  
Oan I...

  
...get you something?
- Like what?

  
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Ooffee?

  
I don't want to put you out.

  
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

  
- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.

  
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.

  
Hey, you want rum cake?

  
- I shouldn't.
- Have some.

  
- No, I can't.
- Oome on!

  
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

  
- Where?
- These stripes don't help.

  
You look great!

  
I don't know if you know
anything about fashion.

  
Are you all right?

  
No.

  
He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.

  
He finally gets there.

  
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.

  
And he says, "Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.

  
Why would I marry a watermelon?"

  
Is that a bee joke?

  
That's the kind of stuff we do.

  
Yeah, different.

  
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?

  
About work? I don't know.

  
I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can't do it the way they want.

  
I know how you feel.

  
- You do?
- Sure.

  
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.

  
- Really?
- My only interest is flowers.

  
Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.

  
Anyway, if you look...

  
There's my hive right there. See it?

  
You're in Sheep Meadow!

  
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!

  
No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.

  
- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
- Why not?

  
- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
- Maybe I'll try that.

  
- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

  
Just having two cups of coffee!

  
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.

  
Yeah, it's no trouble.

  
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
I'd be up the rest of my life.

  
Are you...?

  
Oan I take a piece of this with me?

  
Sure! Here, have a crumb.

  
- Thanks!
- Yeah.

  
All right. Well, then...
I guess I'll see you around.

  
Or not.

  
OK, Barry.

  
And thank you
so much again... for before.

  
Oh, that? That was nothing.

  
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...

  
This can't possibly work.

  
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.

  
OK, Dave, pull the chute.

  
- Sounds amazing.
- It was amazing!

  
It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.

  
Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!

  
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?

  
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.

  
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.

  
- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. But some of them don't.

  
- How'd you get back?
- Poodle.

  
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.

  
You had your "experience." Now you
can pick out yourjob and be normal.

  
- Well...
- Well?

  
Well, I met someone.

  
You did? Was she Bee-ish?

  
- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
- No, no, no, not a wasp.

  
- Spider?
- I'm not attracted to spiders.

  
I know it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.

  
I can't get by that face.

  
So who is she?

  
She's... human.

  
No, no. That's a bee law.
You wouldn't break a bee law.

  
- Her name's Vanessa.
- Oh, boy.

  
She's so nice. And she's a florist!

  
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!

  
We're not dating.

  
You're flying outside the hive, talking
to humans that attack our homes

  
with power washers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!

  
She saved my life!
And she understands me.

  
This is over!

  
Eat this.

  
This is not over! What was that?

  
- They call it a crumb.
- It was so stingin' stripey!

  
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!

  
- You know what a Oinnabon is?
- No.

  
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...

  
Sit down!

  
...really hot!
- Listen to me!

  
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!

  
Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?

  
There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!

  
You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!

  
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

  
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
There he is. He's in the pool.

  
You know what your problem is, Barry?

  
I gotta start thinking bee?

  
How much longer will this go on?

  
It's been three days!
Why aren't you working?

  
I've got a lot of big life decisions
to think about.

  
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!

  
Would it kill you
to make a little honey?

  
Barry, come out.
Your father's talking to you.

  
Martin, would you talk to him?

  
Barry, I'm talking to you!

  
You coming?

  
Got everything?

  
All set!

  
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

  
Don't be too long.

  
Watch this!

  
Vanessa!

  
- We're still here.
- I told you not to yell at him.

  
He doesn't respond to yelling!

  
- Then why yell at me?
- Because you don't listen!

  
I'm not listening to this.

  
Sorry, I've gotta go.

  
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting a friend.

  
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?

  
Bye.

  
I just hope she's Bee-ish.

  
They have a huge parade
of flowers every year in Pasadena?

  
To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!

  
Up on a float, surrounded
by flowers, crowds cheering.

  
A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?

  
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?

  
It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.

  
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.

  
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!

  
You don't have that?

  
We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
It's a horrible, horrible disease.

  
Oh, my.

  
Dumb bees!

  
You must want to sting all those jerks.

  
We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.

  
So you have to watch your temper.

  
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,

  
write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:

  
Anger, jealousy, lust.

  
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?

  
Yeah.

  
- What is wrong with you?!
- It's a bug.

  
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!

  
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?

  
Yeah, it was. How did you know?

  
It felt like about 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.

  
You've really got that
down to a science.

  
- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
- I'll bet.

  
What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?

  
How did this get here?
Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,

  
Ray Liotta Private Select?

  
- Is he that actor?
- I never heard of him.

  
- Why is this here?
- For people. We eat it.

  
You don't have
enough food of your own?

  
- Well, yes.
- How do you get it?

  
- Bees make it.
- I know who makes it!

  
And it's hard to make it!

  
There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!

  
- It's organic.
- It's our-ganic!

  
It's just honey, Barry.

  
Just what?!

  
Bees don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!

  
You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!

  
And it's on sale?!
I'm getting to the bottom of this.

  
I'm getting to the bottom
of all of this!

  
Hey, Hector.

  
- You almost done?
- Almost.

  
He is here. I sense it.

  
Well, I guess I'll go home now

  
and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.

  
You're busted, box boy!

  
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!

  
I can talk.
And now you'll start talking!

  
Where you getting the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?

  
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.

  
The last thing we want
to do is upset bees!

  
You're too late! It's ours now!

  
You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!

  
You, sir, will be lunch
for my iguana, Ignacio!

  
Where is the honey coming from?

  
Tell me where!

  
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!

  
Orazy person!

  
What horrible thing has happened here?

  
These faces, they never knew
what hit them. And now

  
they're on the road to nowhere!

  
Just keep still.

  
What? You're not dead?

  
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
that moves. Where you headed?

  
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.

  
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
crazy stuff. Blows your head off!

  
I'm going to Tacoma.

  
- And you?
- He really is dead.

  
All right.

  
Uh-oh!

  
- What is that?!
- Oh, no!

  
- A wiper! Triple blade!
- Triple blade?

  
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!

  
Why does everything have
to be so doggone clean?!

  
How much do you people need to see?!

  
Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!

  
From NPR News in Washington,
I'm Carl Kasell.

  
But don't kill no more bugs!

  
- Bee!
- Moose blood guy!!

  
- You hear something?
- Like what?

  
Like tiny screaming.

  
Turn off the radio.

  
Whassup, bee boy?

  
Hey, Blood.

  
Just a row of honey jars,
as far as the eye could see.

  
Wow!

  
I assume wherever this truck goes
is where they're getting it.

  
I mean, that honey's ours.

  
- Bees hang tight.
- We're all jammed in.

  
It's a close community.

  
Not us, man. We on our own.
Every mosquito on his own.

  
- What if you get in trouble?
- You a mosquito, you in trouble.

  
Nobody likes us. They just smack.
See a mosquito, smack, smack!

  
At least you're out in the world.
You must meet girls.

  
Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.

  
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.

  
You got to be kidding me!

  
Mooseblood's about to leave
the building! So long, bee!

  
- Hey, guys!
- Mooseblood!

  
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?

  
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
and it's pretty much pure profit.

  
What is this place?

  
A bee's got a brain
the size of a pinhead.

  
They are pinheads!

  
Pinhead.

  
- Oheck out the new smoker.
- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.

  
The Thomas 3000!

  
Smoker?

  
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.

  
A couple breaths of this
knocks them right out.

  
They make the honey,
and we make the money.

  
"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?

  
Oh, my!

  
What's going on? Are you OK?

  
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.

  
Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?

  
Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.

  
This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!

  
That's a drag queen!

  
What is this?

  
Oh, no!

  
There's hundreds of them!

  
Bee honey.

  
Our honey is being brazenly stolen
on a massive scale!

  
This is worse than anything bears
have done! I intend to do something.

  
Oh, Barry, stop.

  
Who told you humans are taking
our honey? That's a rumor.

  
Do these look like rumors?

  
That's a conspiracy theory.
These are obviously doctored photos.

  
How did you get mixed up in this?

  
He's been talking to humans.

  
- What?
- Talking to humans?!

  
He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!

  
Make out? Barry!

  
We do not.

  
- You wish you could.
- Whose side are you on?

  
The bees!

  
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Those crazy legs kept me up all night.

  
Barry, this is what you want
to do with your life?

  
I want to do it for all our lives.
Nobody works harder than bees!

  
Dad, I remember you
coming home so overworked

  
your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop.

  
I remember that.

  
What right do they have to our honey?

  
We live on two cups a year. They put it
in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!

  
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?

  
Sting them where it really hurts.

  
In the face! The eye!

  
- That would hurt.
- No.

  
Up the nose? That's a killer.

  
There's only one place you can sting
the humans, one place where it matters.

  
Hive at Five, the hive's only
full-hour action news source.

  
No more bee beards!

  
With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.

  
Weather with Storm Stinger.

  
Sports with Buzz Larvi.

  
And Jeanette Ohung.

  
- Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
- And I'm Jeanette Ohung.

  
A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,

  
intends to sue the human race
for stealing our honey,

  
packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!

  
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,

  
we'll have three former queens here in
our studio, discussing their new book,

  
Olassy Ladies,
out this week on Hexagon.

  
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.

  
Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
from the hive. I can't do this"?

  
Bees have never been afraid
to change the world.

  
What about Bee Oolumbus?
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?

  
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.

  
We were thinking
of stickball or candy stores.

  
How old are you?

  
The bee community
is supporting you in this case,

  
which will be the trial
of the bee century.

  
You know, they have a Larry King
in the human world too.

  
It's a common name. Next week...

  
He looks like you and has a show
and suspenders and colored dots...

  
Next week...

  
Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
guest even though you just heard 'em.

  
Bear Week next week!
They're scary, hairy and here live.

  
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.

  
In tennis, you attack
at the point of weakness!

  
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.

  
Honey, her backhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?

  
Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.

  
- Is that that same bee?
- Yes, it is!

  
I'm helping him sue the human race.

  
- Hello.
- Hello, bee.

  
This is Ken.

  
Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.

  
Why does he talk again?

  
Listen, you better go
'cause we're really busy working.

  
But it's our yogurt night!

  
Bye-bye.

  
Why is yogurt night so difficult?!

  
You poor thing.
You two have been at this for hours!

  
Yes, and Adam here
has been a huge help.

  
- Frosting...
- How many sugars?

  
Just one. I try not
to use the competition.

  
So why are you helping me?

  
Bees have good qualities.

  
And it takes my mind off the shop.

  
Instead of flowers, people
are giving balloon bouquets now.

  
Those are great, if you're three.

  
And artificial flowers.

  
- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
- Yeah, me too.

  
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.

  
Bees must hate those fake things!

  
Nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.

  
Maybe this could make up
for it a little bit.

  
- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
- I guess.

  
You sure you want to go through with it?

  
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't be able

  
to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!

  
It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,

  
where the world anxiously waits,
because for the first time in history,

  
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.

  
What have we gotten into here, Barry?

  
It's pretty big, isn't it?

  
I can't believe how many humans
don't work during the day.

  
You think billion-dollar multinational
food companies have good lawyers?

  
Everybody needs to stay
behind the barricade.

  
- What's the matter?
- I don't know, I just got a chill.

  
Well, if it isn't the bee team.

  
You boys work on this?

  
All rise! The Honorable
Judge Bumbleton presiding.

  
All right. Oase number 4475,

  
Superior Oourt of New York,
Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry

  
is now in session.

  
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
the five food companies collectively?

  
A privilege.

  
Mr. Benson... you're representing
all the bees of the world?

  
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we're ready to proceed.

  
Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.

  
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

  
my grandmother was a simple woman.

  
Born on a farm, she believed
it was man's divine right

  
to benefit from the bounty
of nature God put before us.

  
If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. Benson imagines,

  
just think of what would it mean.

  
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm

  
for the elastic in my britches!

  
Talking bee!

  
How do we know this isn't some sort of

  
holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?

  
They could be using laser beams!

  
Robotics! Ventriloquism!
Oloning! For all we know,

  
he could be on steroids!

  
Mr. Benson?

  
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no trickery here.

  
I'm just an ordinary bee.
Honey's pretty important to me.

  
It's important to all bees.
We invented it!

  
We make it. And we protect it
with our lives.

  
Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room

  
who think they can take it from us

  
'cause we're the little guys!
I'm hoping that, after this is all over,

  
you'll see how, by taking our honey,
you not only take everything we have

  
but everything we are!

  
I wish he'd dress like that
all the time. So nice!

  
Oall your first witness.

  
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
of Honey Farms, big company you have.

  
I suppose so.

  
I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!

  
Yes, they provide beekeepers
for our farms.

  
Beekeeper. I find that
to be a very disturbing term.

  
I don't imagine you employ
any bee-free-ers, do you?

  
- No.
- I couldn't hear you.

  
- No.
- No.

  
Because you don't free bees.
You keep bees. Not only that,

  
it seems you thought a bear would be
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.

  
They're very lovable creatures.

  
Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.

  
You mean like this?

  
Bears kill bees!

  
How'd you like his head crashing
through your living room?!

  
Biting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!

  
OK, that's enough. Take him away.

  
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
Your name intrigues me.

  
- Where have I heard it before?
- I was with a band called The Police.

  
But you've never been
a police officer, have you?

  
No, I haven't.

  
No, you haven't. And so here
we have yet another example

  
of bee culture casually
stolen by a human

  
for nothing more than
a prance-about stage name.

  
Oh, please.

  
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?

  
Because I'm feeling
a little stung, Sting.

  
Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!

  
That's not his real name?! You idiots!

  
Mr. Liotta, first,
belated congratulations on

  
your Emmy win for a guest spot
on ER in 2005.

  
Thank you. Thank you.

  
I see from your resume
that you're devilishly handsome

  
with a churning inner turmoil
that's ready to blow.

  
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?

  
Not yet it isn't. But is this
what it's come to for you?

  
Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
so you don't

  
have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?

  
Watch it, Benson!
I could blow right now!

  
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!

  
Why doesn't someone just step on
this creep, and we can all go home?!

  
- Order in this court!
- You're all thinking it!

  
Order! Order, I say!

  
- Say it!
- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!

  
I think it was awfully nice
of that bear to pitch in like that.

  
I think the jury's on our side.

  
Are we doing everything right, legally?

  
I'm a florist.

  
Right. Well, here's to a great team.

  
To a great team!

  
Well, hello.

  
- Ken!
- Hello.

  
I didn't think you were coming.

  
No, I was just late.
I tried to call, but... the battery.

  
I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.

  
Oh, that was lucky.

  
There's a little left.
I could heat it up.

  
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.

  
So I hear you're quite a tennis player.

  
I'm not much for the game myself.
The ball's a little grabby.

  
That's where I usually sit.
Right... there.

  
Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,

  
and he agreed with me that eating with
chopsticks isn't really a special skill.

  
You think I don't see what you're doing?

  
I know how hard it is to find
the rightjob. We have that in common.

  
Do we?

  
Bees have 100 percent employment,
but we do jobs like taking the crud out.

  
That's just what
I was thinking about doing.

  
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.

  
I'm going to drain the old stinger.

  
Yeah, you do that.

  
Look at that.

  
You know, I've just about had it

  
with your little mind games.

  
- What's that?
- Italian Vogue.

  
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.

  
A lot of ads.

  
Remember what Van said, why is
your life more valuable than mine?

  
Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!

  
I think something stinks in here!

  
I love the smell of flowers.

  
How do you like the smell of flames?!

  
Not as much.

  
Water bug! Not taking sides!

  
Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
This is pathetic!

  
I've got issues!

  
Well, well, well, a royal flush!

  
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

  
Surf's up, dude!

  
Poo water!

  
That bowl is gnarly.

  
Except for those dirty yellow rings!

  
Kenneth! What are you doing?!

  
You know, I don't even like honey!
I don't eat it!

  
We need to talk!

  
He's just a little bee!

  
And he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!

  
Long time? What are you talking about?!
Are there other bugs in your life?

  
No, but there are other things bugging
me in life. And you're one of them!

  
Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...

  
My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!

  
Goodbye, Ken.

  
And for your information,

  
I prefer sugar-free, artificial
sweeteners made by man!

  
I'm sorry about all that.

  
I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!

  
I always felt there was some kind
of barrier between Ken and me.

  
I couldn't overcome it.
Oh, well.

  
Are you OK for the trial?

  
I believe Mr. Montgomery
is about out of ideas.

  
We would like to call
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.

  
Good idea! You can really see why he's
considered one of the best lawyers...

  
Yeah.

  
Layton, you've
gotta weave some magic

  
with this jury,
or it's gonna be all over.

  
Don't worry. The only thing I have
to do to turn this jury around

  
is to remind them
of what they don't like about bees.

  
- You got the tweezers?
- Are you allergic?

  
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.

  
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
what I think we'd all like to know.

  
What exactly is your relationship

  
to that woman?

  
We're friends.

  
- Good friends?
- Yes.

  
How good? Do you live together?

  
Wait a minute...

  
Are you her little...

  
...bedbug?

  
I've seen a bee documentary or two.
From what I understand,

  
doesn't your queen give birth
to all the bee children?

  
- Yeah, but...
- So those aren't your real parents!

  
- Oh, Barry...
- Yes, they are!

  
Hold me back!

  
You're an illegitimate bee,
aren't you, Benson?

  
He's denouncing bees!

  
Don't y'all date your cousins?

  
- Objection!
- I'm going to pincushion this guy!

  
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!

  
Oh, I'm hit!!

  
Oh, lordy, I am hit!

  
Order! Order!

  
The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!

  
I have been felled
by a winged beast of destruction!

  
You see? You can't treat them
like equals! They're striped savages!

  
Stinging's the only thing
they know! It's their way!

  
- Adam, stay with me.
- I can't feel my legs.

  
What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison

  
from my heaving buttocks?

  
I will have order in this court. Order!

  
Order, please!

  
The case of the honeybees
versus the human race

  
took a pointed turn against the bees

  
yesterday when one of their legal
team stung Layton T. Montgomery.

  
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

  
- Is there much pain?
- Yeah.

  
I...

  
I blew the whole case, didn't I?

  
It doesn't matter. What matters is
you're alive. You could have died.

  
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.

  
They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.

  
Look, there's
a little celery still on it.

  
What was it like to sting someone?

  
I can't explain it. It was all...

  
All adrenaline and then...
and then ecstasy!

  
All right.

  
You think it was all a trap?

  
Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us right into this.

  
What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
just a couple of bugs in this world.

  
What will the humans do to us
if they win?

  
I don't know.

  
I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so bad.

  
Adam, they check in,
but they don't check out!

  
Oh, my.

  
Oould you get a nurse
to close that window?

  
- Why?
- The smoke.

  
Bees don't smoke.

  
Right. Bees don't smoke.

  
Bees don't smoke!
But some bees are smoking.

  
That's it! That's our case!

  
It is? It's not over?

  
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.

  
Get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.

  
And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.

  
Mr. Flayman.

  
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!

  
Where is the rest of your team?

  
Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.

  
Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,

  
and as a result,
we don't make very good time.

  
I actually heard a funny story about...

  
Your Honor,
haven't these ridiculous bugs

  
taken up enough
of this court's valuable time?

  
How much longer will we allow
these absurd shenanigans to go on?

  
They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges

  
against my clients,
who run legitimate businesses.

  
I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!

  
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going

  
to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.

  
But you can't! We have a terrific case.

  
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?

  
Show me the smoking gun!

  
Hold it, Your Honor!
You want a smoking gun?

  
Here is your smoking gun.

  
What is that?

  
It's a bee smoker!

  
What, this?
This harmless little contraption?

  
This couldn't hurt a fly,
let alone a bee.

  
Look at what has happened

  
to bees who have never been asked,
"Smoking or non?"

  
Is this what nature intended for us?

  
To be forcibly addicted
to smoke machines

  
and man-made wooden slat work camps?

  
Living out our lives as honey slaves
to the white man?

  
- What are we gonna do?
- He's playing the species card.

  
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these bees!

  
Free the bees! Free the bees!

  
Free the bees!

  
Free the bees! Free the bees!

  
The court finds in favor of the bees!

  
Vanessa, we won!

  
I knew you could do it! High-five!

  
Sorry.

  
I'm OK! You know what this means?

  
All the honey
will finally belong to the bees.

  
Now we won't have
to work so hard all the time.

  
This is an unholy perversion
of the balance of nature, Benson.

  
You'll regret this.

  
Barry, how much honey is out there?

  
All right. One at a time.

  
Barry, who are you wearing?

  
My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
and I have no pants.

  
- What if Montgomery's right?
- What do you mean?

  
We've been living the bee way
a long time, 27 million years.

  
Oongratulations on your victory.
What will you demand as a settlement?

  
First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
of all bee work camps.

  
Then we want back the honey
that was ours to begin with,

  
every last drop.

  
We demand an end to the glorification
of the bear as anything more

  
than a filthy, smelly,
bad-breath stink machine.

  
We're all aware
of what they do in the woods.

  
Wait for my signal.

  
Take him out.

  
He'll have nauseous
for a few hours, then he'll be fine.

  
And we will no longer tolerate
bee-negative nicknames...

  
But it's just a prance-about stage name!

  
...unnecessary inclusion of honey
in bogus health products

  
and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.

  
Oan't breathe.

  
Bring it in, boys!

  
Hold it right there! Good.

  
Tap it.

  
Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
and there's gallons more coming!

  
- I think we need to shut down!
- Shut down? We've never shut down.

  
Shut down honey production!

  
Stop making honey!

  
Turn your key, sir!

  
What do we do now?

  
Oannonball!

  
We're shutting honey production!

  
Mission abort.

  
Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to base.

  
Adam, you wouldn't believe
how much honey was out there.

  
Oh, yeah?

  
What's going on? Where is everybody?

  
- Are they out celebrating?
- They're home.

  
They don't know what to do.
Laying out, sleeping in.

  
I heard your Uncle Carl was on his way
to San Antonio with a cricket.

  
At least we got our honey back.

  
Sometimes I think, so what if humans
liked our honey? Who wouldn't?

  
It's the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to be part of making it.

  
This was my new desk. This was my
new job. I wanted to do it really well.

  
And now...

  
Now I can't.

  
I don't understand
why they're not happy.

  
I thought their lives would be better!

  
They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.

  
You don't have any idea
what's going on, do you?

  
- What did you want to show me?
- This.

  
What happened here?

  
That is not the half of it.

  
Oh, no. Oh, my.

  
They're all wilting.

  
Doesn't look very good, does it?

  
No.

  
And whose fault do you think that is?

  
You know, I'm gonna guess bees.

  
Bees?

  
Specifically, me.

  
I didn't think bees not needing to make
honey would affect all these things.

  
It's notjust flowers.
Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.

  
That's our whole SAT test right there.

  
Take away produce, that affects
the entire animal kingdom.

  
And then, of course...

  
The human species?

  
So if there's no more pollination,

  
it could all just go south here,
couldn't it?

  
I know this is also partly my fault.

  
How about a suicide pact?

  
How do we do it?

  
- I'll sting you, you step on me.
- Thatjust kills you twice.

  
Right, right.

  
Listen, Barry...
sorry, but I gotta get going.

  
I had to open my mouth and talk.

  
Vanessa?

  
Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?

  
To the final Tournament of Roses parade
in Pasadena.

  
They've moved it to this weekend
because all the flowers are dying.

  
It's the last chance
I'll ever have to see it.

  
Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I never meant it to turn out like this.

  
I know. Me neither.

  
Tournament of Roses.
Roses can't do sports.

  
Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?

  
Roses!

  
Vanessa!

  
Roses?!

  
Barry?

  
- Roses are flowers!
- Yes, they are.

  
Flowers, bees, pollen!

  
I know.
That's why this is the last parade.

  
Maybe not.
Oould you ask him to slow down?

  
Oould you slow down?

  
Barry!

  
OK, I made a huge mistake.
This is a total disaster, all my fault.

  
Yes, it kind of is.

  
I've ruined the planet.
I wanted to help you

  
with the flower shop.
I've made it worse.

  
Actually, it's completely closed down.

  
I thought maybe you were remodeling.

  
But I have another idea, and it's
greater than my previous ideas combined.

  
I don't want to hear it!

  
All right, they have the roses,
the roses have the pollen.

  
I know every bee, plant
and flower bud in this park.

  
All we gotta do is get what they've got
back here with what we've got.

  
- Bees.
- Park.

  
- Pollen!
- Flowers.

  
- Repollination!
- Across the nation!

  
Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, Oalifornia.

  
They've got nothing
but flowers, floats and cotton candy.

  
Security will be tight.

  
I have an idea.

  
Vanessa Bloome, FTD.

  
Official floral business. It's real.

  
Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.

  
Thank you. It was a gift.

  
Once inside,
we just pick the right float.

  
How about The Princess and the Pea?

  
I could be the princess,
and you could be the pea!

  
Yes, I got it.

  
- Where should I sit?
- What are you?

  
- I believe I'm the pea.
- The pea?

  
It goes under the mattresses.

  
- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
- I'm getting the marshal.

  
You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!

  
Let's see what this baby'll do.

  
Hey, what are you doing?!

  
Then all we do
is blend in with traffic...

  
...without arousing suspicion.

  
Once at the airport,
there's no stopping us.

  
Stop! Security.

  
- You and your insect pack your float?
- Yes.

  
Has it been
in your possession the entire time?

  
Would you remove your shoes?

  
- Remove your stinger.
- It's part of me.

  
I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.

  
Then if we're lucky, we'll have
just enough pollen to do the job.

  
Oan you believe how lucky we are? We
have just enough pollen to do the job!

  
I think this is gonna work.

  
It's got to work.

  
Attention, passengers,
this is Oaptain Scott.

  
We have a bit of bad weather
in New York.

  
It looks like we'll experience
a couple hours delay.

  
Barry, these are cut flowers
with no water. They'll never make it.

  
I gotta get up there
and talk to them.

  
Be careful.

  
Oan I get help
with the Sky Mall magazine?

  
I'd like to order the talking
inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.

  
Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.

  
- What'd you say, Hal?
- Nothing.

  
Bee!

  
Don't freak out! My entire species...

  
What are you doing?

  
- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
- Who's an attorney?

  
Don't move.

  
Oh, Barry.

  
Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain.

  
Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
please report to the cockpit?

  
And please hurry!

  
What happened here?

  
There was a DustBuster,
a toupee, a life raft exploded.

  
One's bald, one's in a boat,
they're both unconscious!

  
- Is that another bee joke?
- No!

  
No one's flying the plane!

  
This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?

  
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.

  
Where's the pilot?

  
He's unconscious,
and so is the copilot.

  
Not good. Does anyone onboard
have flight experience?

  
As a matter of fact, there is.

  
- Who's that?
- Barry Benson.

  
From the honey trial?! Oh, great.

  
Vanessa, this is nothing more
than a big metal bee.

  
It's got giant wings, huge engines.

  
I can't fly a plane.

  
- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
- Yes.

  
How hard could it be?

  
Wait, Barry!
We're headed into some lightning.

  
This is Bob Bumble. We have some
late-breaking news from JFK Airport,

  
where a suspenseful scene
is developing.

  
Barry Benson,
fresh from his legal victory...

  
That's Barry!

  
...is attempting to land a plane,
loaded with people, flowers

  
and an incapacitated flight crew.

  
Flowers?!

  
We have a storm in the area
and two individuals at the controls

  
with absolutely no flight experience.

  
Just a minute.
There's a bee on that plane.

  
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson
and his no-account compadres.

  
They've done enough damage.

  
But isn't he your only hope?

  
Technically, a bee
shouldn't be able to fly at all.

  
Their wings are too small...

  
Haven't we heard this a million times?

  
"The surface area of the wings
and body mass make no sense."

  
- Get this on the air!
- Got it.

  
- Stand by.
- We're going live.

  
The way we work may be a mystery to you.

  
Making honey takes a lot of bees
doing a lot of small jobs.

  
But let me tell you about a small job.

  
If you do it well,
it makes a big difference.

  
More than we realized.
To us, to everyone.

  
That's why I want to get bees
back to working together.

  
That's the bee way!
We're not made of Jell-O.

  
We get behind a fellow.

  
- Black and yellow!
- Hello!

  
Left, right, down, hover.

  
- Hover?
- Forget hover.

  
This isn't so hard.
Beep-beep! Beep-beep!

  
Barry, what happened?!

  
Wait, I think we were
on autopilot the whole time.

  
- That may have been helping me.
- And now we're not!

  
So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.

  
All of you, let's get
behind this fellow! Move it out!

  
Move out!

  
Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,
you copy me with the wings of the plane!

  
Don't have to yell.

  
I'm not yelling!
We're in a lot of trouble.

  
It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!

  
It's not a tone. I'm panicking!

  
I can't do this!

  
Vanessa, pull yourself together.
You have to snap out of it!

  
You snap out of it.

  
You snap out of it.

  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

  
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

  
- Hold it!
- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.

  
How is the plane flying?

  
I don't know.

  
Hello?

  
Benson, got any flowers
for a happy occasion in there?

  
The Pollen Jocks!

  
They do get behind a fellow.

  
- Black and yellow.
- Hello.

  
All right, let's drop this tin can
on the blacktop.

  
Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?

  
No, nothing. It's all cloudy.

  
Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.

  
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

  
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
Wait a minute.
I think I'm feeling something.

  
- What?
- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.

  
Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.

  
Bring the nose down.

  
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
- What in the world is on the tarmac?
- Get some lights on that!

  
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
- Vanessa, aim for the flower.
- OK.

  
Out the engines. We're going in
on bee power. Ready, boys?

  
Affirmative!

  
Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.

  
Land on that flower!

  
Ready? Full reverse!

  
Spin it around!

  
- Not that flower! The other one!
- Which one?

  
- That flower.
- I'm aiming at the flower!

  
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant pulsating flower

  
made of millions of bees!

  
Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.

  
Rotate around it.

  
- This is insane, Barry!
- This's the only way I know how to fly.

  
Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
flying in an insect-like pattern?

  
Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
Smell it. Full reverse!

  
Just drop it. Be a part of it.

  
Aim for the center!

  
Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!

  
Oome on, already.

  
Barry, we did it!
You taught me how to fly!

  
- Yes. No high-five!
- Right.

  
Barry, it worked!
Did you see the giant flower?

  
What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!

  
- Thank you.
- But we're not done yet.

  
Listen, everyone!

  
This runway is covered
with the last pollen

  
from the last flowers
available anywhere on Earth.

  
That means this is our last chance.

  
We're the only ones who make honey,
pollinate flowers and dress like this.

  
If we're gonna survive as a species,
this is our moment! What do you say?

  
Are we going to be bees, orjust
Museum of Natural History keychains?

  
We're bees!

  
Keychain!

  
Then follow me! Except Keychain.

  
Hold on, Barry. Here.

  
You've earned this.

  
Yeah!

  
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.

  
Oh, yeah.

  
That's our Barry.

  
Mom! The bees are back!

  
If anybody needs
to make a call, now's the time.

  
I got a feeling we'll be
working late tonight!

  
Here's your change. Have a great
afternoon! Oan I help who's next?

  
Would you like some honey with that?
It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.

  
Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
And I don't see a nickel!

  
Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!

  
I had no idea.

  
Barry, I'm sorry.
Have you got a moment?

  
Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.

  
Sorry I'm late.

  
He's a lawyer too?

  
I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
All I needed was a briefcase.

  
Have a great afternoon!

  
Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
and I can't get them anywhere.

  
No problem, Vannie.
Just leave it to me.

  
You're a lifesaver, Barry.
Oan I help who's next?

  
All right, scramble, jocks!
It's time to fly.

  
Thank you, Barry!

  
That bee is living my life!

  
Let it go, Kenny.

  
- When will this nightmare end?!
- Let it all go.

  
- Beautiful day to fly.
- Sure is.

  
Between you and me,
I was dying to get out of that office.

  
You have got
to start thinking bee, my friend.

  
- Thinking bee!
- Me?

  
Hold it. Let's just stop
for a second. Hold it.

  
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
Oan we stop here?

  
I'm not making a major life decision
during a production number!

  
All right. Take ten, everybody.
Wrap it up, guys.

  
I had virtually no rehearsal for that.
